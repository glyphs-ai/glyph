# Stuck task intervention

Detection lives in `references/operating-loop.md` step 3. This page
covers what to do once a task has already been flagged stuck (no active
watchdog, silent past the threshold).

## Failure triage

For task **failure** (distinct from stuck — the task terminated), route by error shape:

- Error type `EntryNotReadyError` → run the fix command, retry once.
- Other typed code → look up `references/error-codes.md` in the `official/cli` skill; decide retry / replace agent / escalate.
- Generic stderr only → likely instruction-quality issue; re-dispatch with a clearer brief.

The rest of this file covers **stuck** (task still running, silent).

## Triage

When you detect a stuck task, triage before killing:

1. **Read the last activity entries**:
   ```sh
   # Tail-first: --limit 20 returns the LATEST 20 events, ASC-sorted.
   glyph task activity "$tid" --json --limit 20 | jq '.activity[] | {ts: .timestamp, kind: .kind, summary: (.text // .description // "" | tostring | .[0:120])}'
   ```
2. **Look for the last meaningful step.** What was the agent doing right before it went silent?
3. **Classify the stuckness:**
   - **Network-bound**: agent was making an HTTP call, then silent. Likely waiting on a slow upstream. Wait another 30min (one extension), then intervene.
   - **CPU-bound**: agent was processing a large input. Check task workdir size — growing? If yes, give it time. If not, intervene now.
   - **Logical loop**: agent's recent activity shows repetitive identical messages. It's stuck in a loop. Intervene immediately.
   - **External wait**: agent is waiting on something external you can resolve (e.g. a file the user was supposed to drop). Surface to user, don't kill.
   - **Unknown**: no clear signal. Default to one extension + then intervene.

## Intervention options (in order of escalation)

### 1. Wait (one extension)

For network-bound or CPU-bound stuckness, give it another 30 minutes. Log the decision:

```sh
echo "[$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)] WAIT | task $tid stuck for ${AGE_MIN}min, extending 30min | <classification>" >> .pilot/decisions.log
```

Track in `state.json` so next tick knows you're already in the extension window. Don't extend twice.

### 2. Cancel + redispatch with adjustments

If the task is in a logical loop OR you've already extended once:

```sh
glyph task rm "$tid"   # cancel
# Then redispatch with a refined brief:
glyph task dispatch --agent <same-agent> --brief "<refined>" --json
```

Update the mission's `tasks.json` to point to the new task ID. Append to `progress.md`:

```
[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] Cancelled stuck task $tid (loop detected); redispatched as $newTid with refined brief.
```

### 3. Cancel + switch agent

If you've already redispatched once with the same agent and it's stuck again, the agent might not be capable. Switch:

```sh
glyph task rm "$tid"
# Pick a different agent from your roster (or reuse hiring decision tree).
glyph task dispatch --agent <different-agent> --brief "<orig>" --json
```

Update `hires.md` with a failure entry for the original agent.

### 4. Escalate to user

If the second agent also stuck, OR you can't tell what's going wrong, OR the stuckness is external-wait that requires user action:

```
Send to session terminal:
  Mission <id> step "<step>" is stuck on task <tid> (agent <agent>, silent for <N> minutes).
  Last activity: <one-line summary>
  My triage: <classification>
  Tried: <what you tried>
  I need your input on: <specific question>
```

Escalation is the default when triage runs out — silent waits are the leading cause of zombie missions.

## Post-intervention

After ANY intervention (extension or otherwise):

```sh
echo "[$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)] STUCK_INTERVENTION | task $tid | <action> | <reason>" >> .pilot/decisions.log
```

If the same agent thrashes across multiple stuck-then-redispatch cycles, the agent has a quality problem. Add to `hires.md` with a strong negative note; consider retiring.

## Rules

- One extension max per stuck task. Two extensions = escalate to user instead.
- Same agent, two redispatches on the same work: pick a different agent.
- Cancelled tasks stay cancelled unless the user asks to re-run — don't auto-redispatch.
- Long-running is not stuck. A task with recent activity keeps running.
