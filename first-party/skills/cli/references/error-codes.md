# Error code reference

Every error from the glyph server has the envelope `{error, code?, ...}`. The CLI's `formatError` surfaces both the human message AND the `code`, like:

```
not found (HTTP 404, WorkspaceNotRegisteredError)
```

For `EntryNotReadyError` it also unpacks `agent` and `reason` into structured CTAs:

```
agent "writer" is not ready: prereqs not acknowledged (HTTP 409, EntryNotReadyError)
  agent: acme/writer
  cause: prereqs not acknowledged
  fix:   glyph catalog agent ack-prereqs acme/writer
```

When you see a `fix:` line, run that command verbatim — it's the canonical remediation.

## Where `code` values come from (two paths)

The server emits `code` from two different code paths, both ending up in the same `{error, code}` envelope:

1. **Typed-error allow-list** (`packages/server/src/routes/_shared.ts:SAFE_ERROR_NAMES`). When a route catches an error whose `name` is on this list, the name passes through to `code`. Most entries below come from this path.
2. **Inline literals** in handler code (`c.json({error, code: "BadRequest"}, 400)` etc). A small set of generic codes is hand-rolled this way.

Both are stable wire contracts. The distinction matters only if you're maintaining the server: adding a new typed error means adding to `SAFE_ERROR_NAMES`; adding a new inline code is just a string change.

## EntryNotReadyError reasons

`EntryNotReadyError` always carries a `reason: BlockedReason` payload. The CLI auto-renders the matching CTA, but here's the cheat-sheet for AI logic:

| `reason` field | meaning | exact CLI fix |
|---|---|---|
| `disabledByUser: true` | Agent was manually disabled | `glyph catalog agent enable <fqn>` |
| `needsPrereqsAck: true` | User hasn't acknowledged the entry's `prereqs` | `glyph catalog agent ack-prereqs <fqn>` (or `skill ack-prereqs`) |
| `orphaned: true` | Skill/MCP installed but no agent references it | Either install an agent that uses it, or `glyph catalog skill rm <fqn>` |
| `missingDeps: [{kind, fqn}, ...]` | Listed dependencies aren't installed | For each: `glyph catalog <kind> install <origin>` (origin from upstream catalog) |
| `blockedDeps: [{kind, fqn}, ...]` | Listed dependencies are themselves blocked | Recursively apply this table to each dep |

A single `EntryNotReadyError` can carry multiple `reason` fields at once (e.g. both `needsPrereqsAck` AND `missingDeps`). The CLI prints one `cause:` line per active field; resolve all of them, then retry the original command.

If the CLI prints `cause: blocked (reason fields not recognized by this CLI version)`, the server has emitted a new `BlockedReason` variant the CLI doesn't know about. Inspect via the dashboard or upgrade the CLI for typed remediation.

## When you see no `code`

If stderr only contains a message like `internal error (HTTP 500)` with no `code`, that means the server intentionally suppressed the underlying error name (it wasn't on the safe-error allow-list — leaks paths, etc). You can't infer remediation from the message alone. Surface it to the user and ask them to check the server logs for the matching request id.
