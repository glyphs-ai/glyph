/**
 * Copies the built dashboard SPA from packages/dashboard/dist/ to
 * bundle/static/ so it sits next to bundle/glyph.js. The bundled server
 * looks for `static/` adjacent to its own location at runtime; this script
 * is what puts it there.
 *
 * Standalone (rather than wired into esbuild via a plugin) for two
 * reasons: easier to debug in isolation, and lets `pnpm bundle` run
 * `node esbuild.config.js && node scripts/copy-dashboard.mjs` as two
 * predictable steps with their own logs.
