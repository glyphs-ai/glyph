 *
 * Output is the `bin` entry of the published `@glyphs-ai/glyph`
 * npm package. At install time, npm symlinks `glyph` to this file;
 * running `glyph` enters the CLI dispatcher (`@glyphs-ai/cli`), which
 * subcommands either talk to a running server over HTTP or, in the
 * case of `serve` / `start`, drive the embedded server directly.
 *
 * Mirrors the approach used by google-gemini/gemini-cli: keep workspace
 * packages private, ship one bundled binary, externalize anything that
 * relies on filesystem-resolved transports (pino) or native bindings.

// real `require()` calls and ship them as runtime dependencies of the
// published package so npm install resolves them in the user's
// node_modules. `thread-stream` is pino's worker entry point and is
// pulled transitively, but listing it explicitly avoids esbuild walking
// into it accidentally if the dep graph shifts.

  // better-sqlite3 is a native module with a `.node` binding loaded

  // module location. Inlining the JS shim into our single-file
  // bundle breaks the bindings search (it looks under the bundle
  // path, not under node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/). Keep it as
  // a real `require()` and declare it as a runtime `dependency` of
  // `@glyphs-ai/glyph` so `npm install` materialises the prebuilt
  // binary into the user's node_modules tree. `bindings` is the
  // tiny resolver better-sqlite3 uses; same treatment.

  // @libsql/client is the SQLite driver used by workspace DBs (via
  // drizzle-orm/libsql). It re-exports the `libsql` package, whose
  // JS shim calls `require('@libsql/<platform>')` at runtime through
  // its own `requireNative()` helper (e.g. `@libsql/win32-x64-msvc`
  // on Windows). Those platform packages ship prebuilt `.node`
  // bindings and are declared as `optionalDependencies` of `libsql`
  // so npm installs only the one matching the host.
  //
  // Inlining `@libsql/client` (and transitively `libsql`) into our
  // single-file bundle severs the `requireNative` lookup: it resolves
  // relative to `bundle/glyph.js`, not to a real
  // `node_modules/@libsql/client/` next to a materialised
  // `node_modules/libsql/`, so the platform package is never found
  // and `glyph start` crashes with
  // `Cannot find module '@libsql/<platform>'` at first startup.
  //
  // Externalising `@libsql/client` keeps the `require()` call intact.
  // We declare `@libsql/client` in the root `package.json`
  // `dependencies`; `npm install -g @glyphs-ai/glyph` then
  // materialises the client, the `libsql` shim, and the correct
  // `@libsql/<platform>` prebuilt binary side by side, and the
  // runtime lookup succeeds.
  "@libsql/client",
  // @github/copilot-sdk wraps the @github/copilot CLI and resolves it at
  // runtime via `import.meta.resolve('@github/copilot/sdk')` (verified
  // against @github/copilot-sdk@1.0.0-beta.4). That call walks the
  // SDK module's own node_modules — which only exists when npm has
  // materialised the SDK alongside its transitive `@github/copilot`
  // dep. Inlining the SDK into our single-file bundle severs both
  // sides of that lookup: the SDK code now lives at the bundle path
  // (not at `node_modules/@github/copilot-sdk/`), and the CLI dep is
  // never installed in the user's tree because the bundled SDK source
  // can't carry its own `dependencies` declaration. Result is a
  // silent `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at first dispatch.
  //
  // Externalising keeps the SDK as a real `import` whose resolution
  // happens through the user's installed `node_modules/@github/
  // copilot-sdk/`, which npm sets up correctly because we declare the
  // SDK in the root `package.json` `dependencies`. The SDK's own
  // `@github/copilot` dep is then resolved transitively by npm — we
  // do NOT declare the CLI directly because that would couple us to
  // its version twice (once via the SDK's package.json, once via
  // ours) and drift on every SDK bump.
