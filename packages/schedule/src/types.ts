 * routes every kind-aware operation (validate, RFC 7396 merge,
 * dispatch, in-flight check, cascade delete) through a
 * {@link ScheduleKindHandler} the caller registers at compose time
 * via `ScheduleService.registerKind(kind, handler)`. The pkg has no
 * built-in knowledge of "task", "workflow", or any other concrete
 * kind — adding one requires zero edits to `packages/schedule/src/`.
 *
 * See `packages/api/src/wiring/schedule-task-handler.ts` for the
 * production task-kind handler and `README.md` for the composition
 * snippet.

 * dispatch of `data`.
 *
 * On disk: `kind` lives in the `schedules.target_kind` column and
 * `data` is `JSON.stringify`ed into `schedules.target_json`. The
 * kind is NOT redundantly nested inside `target_json` (see

/**
 * Per-kind handler registered at compose time. Implementations live

 * lives in `packages/api/src/wiring/schedule-task-handler.ts` because
 * it knows about `@glyphs-ai/schedule`, `@glyphs-ai/task`, AND
 * `@glyphs-ai/catalog`. The schedule pkg itself never imports any of
 * its callers.
 *
 * All methods receive `data: unknown` and are responsible for the
 * shape check. Implementations should throw caller-meaningful errors
 * (the task handler throws task-pkg's `AgentNotFoundError` /
 * `AgentResolutionFailedError` directly on catalog miss / failure);
 * those propagate through the schedule pkg untouched, and the
 * server's error-policy table maps them to the right HTTP status.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally non-generic. Per-kind type safety
 * lives at the EDGES: route handlers narrow from `unknown` to the
 * typed shape before calling `service.create`; handlers cast
 * `unknown` immediately after their own `validate` produces a value.
 * A `ScheduleKindHandler<TData>` generic would defeat the
 * open-registry goal (every caller would need to track the kind→T
 * mapping at compile time).
