/**
 * Structural enforcement of the "facade + sibling subdir" split
 * convention documented in `docs/pkg-template.md § Splitting big
 * files via facade + sibling subdir`.
 *
 * Algorithm: walk every directory under `packages/<pkg>/src/**` and
 * classify it:
 *
 *   - SPLIT    — a sibling file `<X>.ts` OR `<X>.tsx` exists at the
 *                parent level (exact case match). The subdir is part
 *                of a facade-split and must not contain a barrel.
 *   - CATEGORY — no sibling file at the parent level. The subdir is
 *                a categorical container (e.g. `routes/`,
 *                `components/`, per-entity subfolders like `agent/`).
 *                These are subject-oriented containers, not facade
 *                splits, and are NOT subject to this rule.
 *
 * Enforced invariants on every SPLIT (from `docs/pkg-template.md §
 * Hard rules`):
 *
 *   - Rule #2 — SPLIT subdir MUST NOT contain `index.ts` /
 *     `index.tsx` (the facade is the only public entry).
 *   - Rule #5a (no nesting) — a SPLIT subdir MUST NOT recursively
 *     contain another SPLIT (i.e. no descendant `.ts` / `.tsx` file
 *     whose basename equals a sibling subdir under the SPLIT).
 *   - "Every SPLIT must be empty-OK-only-if-empty" — every SPLIT
 *     subdir contains at least one `.ts` / `.tsx` file.
 *   - `REQUIRED_SPLITS` is the *exact* set of on-disk SPLITs.
 *     Forgetting to register a new split (silent loss of the
 *     facade-deletion guard) fails as loudly as forgetting to
 *     deregister a collapsed split. Asserted with set-equality.
 *   - `EXPECTED_CATEGORY_DIRS_AT_CONVENTION_INTRODUCTION` is the
 *     protected CATEGORY-dir set. Every entry MUST still classify as
 *     CATEGORY (silent promotion to SPLIT — by someone adding a
 *     sibling `<name>.ts` file — fails the test). New packages may add
 *     fresh CATEGORY dirs without updating the set; it is a lower
 *     bound on which dirs must stay CATEGORY, not a registry of every
 *     CATEGORY in existence.
 *
 * Case policy: sibling matching is exact-case (because Linux CI is
 * case-sensitive). On Windows / macOS the filesystem is typically
 * case-insensitive but `readdirSync` preserves the on-disk casing, so
 * the equality check still behaves consistently across platforms.

 * intentionally promoted to SPLIT (in which case it must also be added
 * to `REQUIRED_SPLITS`) or physically deleted.

 * dashboard, runtime, server, terminal — i.e. every CATEGORY the
