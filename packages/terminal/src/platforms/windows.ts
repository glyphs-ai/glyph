/**
 * Windows: try Windows Terminal (`wt.exe`) first, fall back to `cmd.exe`.
 *
 * The WindowsApps stub for wt.exe is unreliable on Win10 (can redirect to
 * Microsoft Store), so we attempt to spawn it and watch for an immediate
 * error/exit. If wt fails fast we fall through to the cmd.exe fallback.
 *
 * `path.win32.join` (not `path.join`) is required because tests inject
 * `platform: "win32"` while running on Linux/macOS CI runners — host-relative
 * path.join would mix separators and miss the WindowsApps stub.
 *
 * NOTE: the `exists` check must handle App Execution Aliases (0-byte reparse
 * points with tag `IO_REPARSE_TAG_APPEXECLINK`). `fs.existsSync` follows the
 * reparse point and returns false for these — if not handled the wt branch
 * is silently unreachable even when Windows Terminal is installed. Default
 * dependencies use `lstatSync` via `existsLike` (see `_shared.ts`); test
 * dependencies inject `filesTable` directly.
 *
 * SHELL HOSTING: the target command is wrapped in a PowerShell
 * `-NoLogo -NoExit -Command "& '<cmd>' '<arg>' …"` envelope rather than
 * being handed to wt.exe directly. Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. Interactive CLIs are more reliable when a shell performs the final
 *      invocation inside the new terminal. Hosting via pwsh matches the
 *      manual-launch path users already run successfully and avoids
 *      ConPTY size-detection sensitivity in immediate-child CLI launches.
 *
 *   2. `-NoExit` keeps the window open after the command terminates, so the
 *      user can read exit messages and re-run without losing the tab.
 *
 * `pwsh.exe` is preferred (PowerShell 7+, Windows Terminal default
 * profile); we fall back to `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5,
 * always present on Windows ≥ 7) if pwsh isn't on PATH. If neither is
 * available the wt branch passes the target command directly — better
 * than silently failing, even if immediate-child terminal quirks may
 * then surface.

/**
 * Compose the argv we pass to `wt.exe`. Picks the best available shell
 * host (pwsh → powershell → none) and wraps the LaunchCommand so wt opens
 * a tab in that host with the command pre-running.
 *
 * When neither pwsh nor powershell is on PATH we fall through to wt's
 * bare direct-command form rather than failing the launch. A direct tab
 * may be less reliable for interactive CLIs, but it still gives the user
 * a chance to work instead of failing before a terminal opens.
 *
 * Env injection: when `cmd.env` is non-empty AND we have a pwsh host,
 * we prepend `$env:K = 'v'; …; ` to the -Command payload. wt.exe runs
 * as a daemon, so spawn-time env doesn't reach the new tab — but the
 * pwsh process we invoke inside the tab is under our control, so
 * setting `$env:` before `&`-invoking the target command reliably puts
 * the variables into that process's environment. The no-shell-host branch
 * can't carry env (wt argv is run without a shell) so we silently drop the
 * env there; in practice every modern Windows install ships with at
 * least powershell.exe, so this path is essentially unreachable.
 *
 * CRITICAL — wt.exe semicolon escaping:
 * `wt.exe` interprets `;` as its OWN command separator (per
 * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/command-line-arguments).
 * Even when `;` appears inside what we think is a single argv element,
 * wt's parser splits the whole command line on unescaped `;` and
 * spawns a new tab/window for each chunk. That's why an unescaped
 * `$env:A = 'x'; $env:B = 'y'; & 'cmd'` payload opens THREE tabs
 * (one per chunk) instead of running the script. Escape every `;`
 * with `\;` so wt passes a literal semicolon through to pwsh.
 *
 * The escape only needs to happen on the path where we PUT a semicolon
 * into the payload — i.e. when `cmd.env` was non-empty. We still apply
 * the replace unconditionally because it's a cheap no-op when the
 * payload contains no `;` and keeps semicolon-bearing command names,
 * args, and env values data-only.
