/**
 * In-process fake implementing the runtime's `AgentContentSource`
 * port. Fixtures are stored in Maps and read directly — no install
 * pipeline, no SQLite, no `_meta` injection.
 *
 * Why a fake instead of the real catalog:
 *
 *   1. The runtime is the bottom layer of the package graph;
 *      depending on the catalog (even as a test-only devDep)
 *      visually suggests runtime → catalog coupling that does not
 *      exist in production code.
 *   2. Alt-catalog packages cannot integration-test against runtime
 *      without duplicating fixture infrastructure tied to one
 *      catalog implementation.
 *   3. The narrow surface (no install pipeline, no SQLite, no
 *      `_meta` injection) makes test failures easy to localize.
 *
 * The fake intentionally does NOT:
 *
 *   - Parse `AGENTS.md` / `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Skill / MCP
 *     dependencies are declared in the fixture's `deps` field
 *     explicitly — tests must spell out their dependency graph
 *     instead of leaning on frontmatter parsing.
 *   - Inject or strip `_meta`. Fixtures pass through verbatim;
 *     MCP configs must be pre-stripped (runtime-shape).
 *   - Validate FQNs against the catalog's install rules. The fake's
 *     job is to satisfy the runtime's port, not to enforce catalog
 *     authoring conventions.
 *
 * Type imports come from `../../src/types.js` directly because this is a
 * same-package test fixture. Public consumers import the same structural
 * port through `@glyphs-ai/runtime`.

 * Cycle handling MIRRORS the production catalog's resolve-time
 * walker (`buildLocalClosure` in
 * `packages/catalog/src/facade/resolve-pipeline.ts`): the
 * `visited.has(fqn)` guard fires on the second visit to any node,
 * so a back-edge is silently absorbed rather than thrown.
 * Catalog rejects cyclic graphs at install/sync time via
 * `CyclicDependencyError`, so by the time `resolveAgent` runs in
 * production the graph is acyclic by construction; the visited
 * dedupe is a termination safety net only.
