 * `.github/skills/acme/weather/` would be misread, so scoped skill
 * names must be flattened to a single segment.
 *
 * **Critical**: the CLI also silently de-duplicates skills with the
 * same `name` field — when two SKILL.md files share `name: tool-use`, only
 * the first one in readdir order survives, with no warning. This means the
 * frontmatter `name` field MUST also be rewritten to the flattened form,
 * not just the directory. Empirical testing confirmed that names
 * containing `__` / `.` / `-` are all accepted by the CLI; only `/`,
 * `:`, `@` are silently rejected.
 *
 * Double-underscore is unambiguous: catalog grammar is kebab-case
 * (`[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*`), so `__` cannot appear in a valid name.
 *
 * Hook files in `.github/hooks/` get the same prefix for the same reason:
 * if two skills (different scopes, same short name) both contribute a
 * `setup.json` hook, the second would overwrite the first inside
 * `.github/hooks/`. Prefixing with `<scope>__<short>__` guarantees
 * disjoint filenames; per the official CLI hooks reference the runtime
 * loads every `*.json` under `.github/hooks/`, so the prefix is harmless.

 *   .github/hooks/<flatname>__<file> — merged from each skill's hooks/copilot/
 *
 * `placeholders.workspaceDir` and `placeholders.sharedDir` are required;
 * they're substituted into MCP `args` / `env` / nested string fields so
 * portable specs can refer to per-workspace and per-machine
 * state without baking absolute host paths into JSON.
 *
 * Note: no `git init` is run. Copilot CLI loads hooks from
 * `<cwd>/.github/hooks/*.json` directly — it does not require a `.git/`
 * directory and does not walk up to find a git root (per the official
 * hooks reference at
 * docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-hooks-reference).
 * Skipping `git init` removes a hard dependency on the host's `git`
 * binary and avoids planting `.git/` directories that would otherwise
 * need cleanup when the owning session, task, or workflow artifacts are
 * purged.
 *
 * Source data is pulled from the catalog as `AsyncIterable<{relPath, content}>`
 * streams (see {@link AgentContentSource.skillEntries} /
 * {@link AgentContentSource.agentEntries}). The runtime never resolves on-disk
 * catalog paths; alternate catalog storage works the same way.
 *
 * Does NOT touch the Copilot CLI's `config.json` `trustedFolders`.
 * Folder-trust is `CopilotRuntime.buildInteractiveLaunch`'s preflight
 * (it writes the workspace dir into `config.json` immediately before
 * producing the launch spec, idempotently and with ancestor
 * coverage). Keeping the two concerns separate lets workspaces that
 * are only used for SDK-headless launches skip the trust write entirely.
 *
 * Idempotent in the trivial sense (re-running with the same inputs produces
 * the same files), but callers provision into freshly-created empty workdirs
 * so we never rely on that.
 *
 * When two skills contribute non-hook files at the same relative path
 * under `.github/skills/<flatname>/`, the later one wins (impossible
 * across distinct skills since each gets its own directory; only matters
 * within a single skill's own tree). Hook files cannot collide across
 * skills because of the `<flatname>__` filename prefix.
