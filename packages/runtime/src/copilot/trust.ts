/**
 * Persistence + concurrency for `~/.copilot/config.json.trustedFolders`.
 *
 * # Why `config.json` and not `settings.json`?
 *
 * The Copilot CLI exposes two top-level user files in `~/.copilot/`:
 *
 *   - `settings.json` — documented "user settings" (logLevel, model, …).
 *     It happens to also accept a `trustedFolders` field syntactically,
 *     but the CLI **silently ignores** it for trust-gate decisions.
 *
 *   - `config.json` — leading comment says "managed automatically", which
 *     makes it look off-limits for hand-edits. It is in fact the ONLY
 *     file the CLI reads `trustedFolders` from. Verified empirically
 *     against Copilot CLI 1.0.44 by writing identical entries to both
 *     files and observing that only the `config.json` entry suppressed
 *     the "Confirm folder trust" prompt in `-i` mode.
 *
 * Using `config.json` is therefore both correct and stable. Writing to
 * `settings.json` (the file the leading comment in `config.json` points
 * readers at) is a no-op for the trust gate, so an interactive launch
 * in a "registered" workspace would still hit the blocking "Confirm
 * folder trust" prompt.
 *
 * # When this runs (lazy, per-launch)
 *
 * `ensureDirTrusted` is called from `CopilotRuntime.buildInteractiveLaunch` as a
 * pre-launch preflight, NOT from a workspace-bootstrap hook. The first
 * interactive launch in a workspace pays one read+write of `config.json`;
 * every subsequent launch hits the "already covered" early return after
 * a single read. That keeps `trustedFolders` O(workspaces) (one entry
 * per workspace via ancestor coverage) and means workspaces that are
 * only used for SDK-headless launches never touch the file.
 *
 * # Why Copilot-only
 *
 * The whole module is intentionally Copilot-specific. Trust is not
 * lifted into the cross-runtime `Runtime` interface; each runtime
 * adapter owns its own preconditions and decides where to enforce them.
 *
 * # IO mechanics
 *
 * The atomic-write + cross-process lock primitives come from two
 * focused npm libraries:
 *   - `write-file-atomic` — write-temp + rename, so concurrent
 *     buildInteractiveLaunch preflights from multiple dashboard
 *     sessions cannot partially write `config.json`.
 *   - `proper-lockfile` — PID-aware advisory lock with stale
 *     recovery; serialises the read-modify-write of
 *     `trustedFolders` so two concurrent preflights cannot both
 *     pass `isPathCovered` before either writes (lose-update).
 */

/**
 * Make sure `dir` is covered by `<configPath>.trustedFolders` so the
 * spawned interactive Copilot CLI (`-i`, see `buildInteractiveLaunch`) does not
 * interrupt the user with a per-folder trust prompt.
 *
 * `configPath` is normally `~/.copilot/config.json` — see the module
 * jsdoc for why this file (and not `settings.json`) is the correct
 * authority for `trustedFolders`. The SDK-headless mode used by
 * `launchCopilotHeadless` has no folder-trust gate (the SDK's
 * `approveAll` permission handler bypasses it) and therefore does
 * NOT call this function.
 *
 * Coverage rules (see `isPathCovered`):
 *   - exact match on the resolved absolute path counts as trusted
 *   - any ancestor directory listed in `trustedFolders` counts as trusted
 *
 * Concurrency: the entire read-modify-write sequence runs under a
 * `proper-lockfile` advisory lock on `<configPath>`. Without the
 * lock, two concurrent buildInteractiveLaunch preflights could both
 * pass `isPathCovered` before either wrote, then the second
 * `write-file-atomic` would clobber the first writer's unrelated
 * changes.
 *
 * Failure modes — every failure path (mkdir, lock timeout, atomic
 * write, parent permissions) is wrapped as {@link TrustRegistrationFailed}.
 * That gives `buildInteractiveLaunch` a single, typed catch surface
 * and preserves the underlying error message (which for a
 * `proper-lockfile` timeout includes the holder PID — the operator's
 * only handle to a wedged trust write).
 *
 * If `dir` (or an ancestor) is already covered, the file is left untouched.
 * A missing or unparseable config file is treated as "start fresh"; we
 * never refuse to launch because the user's config is corrupted (that
 * would block the very first session on a new install).
