/**
 * SDK-based headless launch for the Copilot runtime.
 *
 * We instantiate one {@link CopilotClient} per headless launch. Each client spawns
 * its own CLI subprocess via the SDK so per-launch `workingDirectory`
 * isolation is preserved (any tool that resolves paths against
 * `process.cwd()` rather than the session's workingDirectory would
 * otherwise leak across concurrent launches under a shared client).
 *
 * Events arrive via `onEvent` (registered BEFORE `createSession`'s RPC
 * fires, so even the early `session.start` event lands in our buffer).
 * Every event is pushed into an in-memory `SessionEvent[]` and fanned
 * out to subscribers. The {@link CopilotRuntime} keeps a
 * `Map<sessionId, EventBuffer>` and serves `readActivity` /
 * `streamActivity` from it directly — no `events.jsonl` polling.
 *
 * The returned {@link RuntimeHandle.exit} resolves when `session.idle`
 * fires (model has nothing more to do) OR the underlying client/session
 * errors out. `kill()` calls `session.abort()` (graceful — model
 * finishes the current turn, then stops).
