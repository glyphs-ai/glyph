/**
 * Server-bootstrap preflight for the Copilot runtime.
 *
 * Asserts that `@github/copilot-sdk` AND its transitive `@github/copilot`
 * CLI dep are present in the running process's module graph BEFORE the
 * server starts accepting traffic. Fail-fast — better to surface a
 * missing-dep misconfiguration at boot than to let every
 * `tasks.dispatch` fail with a silent `HTTP 400 internal error` later
 * on (each request would otherwise fail with a generic "internal error"
 * body and no breadcrumb).
 *
 * # Why this exists (root cause)
 *
 * The SDK's `CopilotClient` resolves the bundled CLI binary at runtime
 * via `import.meta.resolve('@github/copilot/sdk')`. That call walks the
 * SDK module's own `node_modules` — which only exists when npm has
 * materialised both packages alongside our bundle. If either is missing
 * (e.g. the SDK was inlined into `bundle/glyph.js` and not declared
 * as a runtime dep of `@glyphs-ai/glyph`, OR an operator deleted
 * the SDK from `node_modules` after install), the resolution throws
 * `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at first dispatch and the request fails with
 * a generic "internal error" body. This preflight catches the SDK- and
 * CLI-missing failure modes at boot.
 *
 * # MODULE_NOT_FOUND vs ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED
 *
 * Step 2 below probes the CLI dep via CJS-style resolution
 * (`createRequire(sdkUrl).resolve('@github/copilot/sdk')`). The CLI's
 * `package.json` `exports` map declares only the ESM `import` condition
 * for the `./sdk` subpath, so the CJS resolver throws even when the
 * package is fully installed — but the thrown error code is
 * `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, NOT a missing-module error. We
 * distinguish:
 *
 *   - `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (CJS) or `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (ESM) →
 *     package itself is unreachable on disk → fail the preflight
 *     (this is the packaging-chain bug we are guarding against)
 *   - `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` → package exists on disk; only
 *     the subpath isn't visible to the CJS resolver. The SDK's own
 *     ESM `import.meta.resolve` at runtime DOES honour the `import`
 *     condition and will succeed → preflight passes.
 *
 * This split lets us re-use the cheap, sync `createRequire` API for
 * presence-checking without false-positiving on packages that publish
 * ESM-only conditional exports.
 *
 * # Why this is a function, not in the constructor
 *
 * Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. Unit tests construct `CopilotRuntime` directly without going
 *      through a server boot; running the preflight in the constructor
 *      would force every test fixture (including ones that mock
 *      `headlessDeps.createClient` and never actually load the SDK)
 *      to satisfy a real install. Decoupling lets the test fixture
 *      stay light while the real `runServer` boot path still pays the
 *      check exactly once.
 *
 *   2. The preflight only protects the user-facing install path
 *      (npm-installed bundle). In monorepo source-mode dev the SDK
 *      always resolves via pnpm workspace symlinks; gating
 *      construction on a check that can never fail in dev would be
 *      noise. Wiring it explicitly at the bootstrap site makes the
 *      relationship between "this matters for shipped binaries" and
 *      "this runs at server start" legible at the call site.

/**
 * Run the Copilot SDK resolvability preflight. Returns void on success;

 *
 * Two-step probe:
 *
 *   1. `@github/copilot-sdk` resolvable from this module — what the
 *      runtime adapter `import`s.
 *   2. `@github/copilot` (the CLI binary's package) resolvable FROM
 *      THE SDK'S OWN MODULE URL — mirrors the resolution the SDK
 *      itself does at runtime via `import.meta.resolve('@github/
 *      copilot/sdk')`. Scoped via `createRequire(sdkUrl)` because
 *      pnpm does NOT hoist transitive deps into the consuming
 *      package's node_modules; a naive resolve from preflight.ts
 *      would false-positive in monorepo dev (where the CLI dep is
 *      reachable via the SDK's virtual store but unreachable when
 *      the SDK is imported standalone — the user-install failure
 *      mode).
 *
 * Uses `import.meta.resolve` and `createRequire(...).resolve` (both
 * sync, stable in Node ≥ 22 per glyph's engines field). Neither
 * actually imports or executes the SDK, so we don't pay the SDK's
 * import cost at boot for a check that is purely about presence.
 *
 * See the module-level jsdoc for why we filter on the resolver's
 * error code to distinguish "package missing" from "subpath uses
 * ESM-only exports".
 *
 * The optional `deps` parameter is a test seam: production callers get
 * the real Node resolvers, while tests pass synthetic deps that throw
 * the codes under test without touching the real module graph.
