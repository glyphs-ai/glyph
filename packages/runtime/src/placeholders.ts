/**
 * Placeholder substitution for runtime-projected configuration strings.
 *
 * Portable MCP specs cannot embed machine-specific absolute paths and
 * cannot rely on shell variable expansion (the MCP
 * spec at modelcontextprotocol.io has no `${VAR}` mechanism, and
 * wrapping commands in `bash -c "..."` so the shell does the expansion
 * breaks Windows immediately). This module provides glyph's own
 * placeholder grammar — a tiny, scheme-free `${name}` syntax with a
 * fixed vocabulary — so spec authors can write portable references
 * without leaking the host OS into their JSON.
 *
 * Vocabulary (intentionally small):
 *
 *   ${workspaceDir}   the absolute path of the workspace this
 *                     work item belongs to (`<workspaceDir>`, the
 *                     root for glyph-owned session, task, and
 *                     workflow artifacts).
 *                     Pick this for state that should be PRIVATE to one
 *                     workspace — playwright cookies tied to one
 *                     project, repo-scoped credential caches.
 *
 *   ${sharedDir}      a stable per-user directory (`<GLYPH_HOME>/shared`
 *                     by default). Pick this for state that should be
 *                     SHARED across all workspaces and launch types on
 *                     this machine — a single playwright login the
 *                     user wants every project to reuse, a global API
 *                     token cache.
 *
 * The two placeholders carve a clean scope axis (per-workspace vs
 * per-machine) without leaking glyph's product name into spec authors'
 * configs. `${HOME}`, `$HOME`, `~`, `${userHome}`, `${glyphHome}`,
 * and per-run directory placeholders are intentionally unsupported:
 * catalog specs choose between project-private state
 * (`${workspaceDir}`), user-account state (`${sharedDir}`), or
 * relative paths under the subprocess cwd for transient files.
 *
 * Substitution is purely lexical: `${workspaceDir}` is replaced
 * verbatim wherever it appears in a string, anywhere. There is no
 * conditional, no fallback, no `${var:-default}` shell-style syntax.
 * If a placeholder name isn't recognised, {@link substitutePlaceholders}
 * throws {@link UnknownPlaceholderError} so a typo surfaces at provision
 * time instead of producing a literal `${typo}` path that some downstream
 * tool then opens against `cwd`.
 *
 * Paths produced by substitution are always returned with FORWARD
 * slashes, even on Windows — Node's `fs` accepts `C:/Users/...` natively
 * and shipping forward-slash paths in JSON keeps catalog specs
 * visually identical across platforms (no `\\` escaping).
 */

// Loose match `${...}` so any name we DON'T recognise still surfaces as
// {@link UnknownPlaceholderError} instead of silently passing through.
// Strict validation happens in {@link substitutePlaceholders}: only
// {@link PLACEHOLDER_NAMES} resolve; everything else throws. The
// rationale is "fail loud on a typo" — a stray `${workspceDir}` in a
// spec would otherwise expand to a literal `${workspceDir}` substring
// that downstream MCP servers would dutifully open against `cwd`,
// producing inscrutable runtime errors instead of a clear provision-time
// rejection.
