 *   - {@link readActivity}: paginated parsed timeline

 * when the upstream provides per-class breakdown:
 *  - `cached` = Anthropic prompt-cache READ (charged ~10× cheaper than
 *    fresh input, often >90% of `input` on long sessions)
 *  - `cacheWrite` = prompt-cache WRITE (charged ~1.25× input on the
