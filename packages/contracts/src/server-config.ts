/**
 * Resolved server configuration values that the dashboard needs to
 * display accurately. Sourcing these from the server (rather than
 * hardcoding the defaults in dashboard copy) means the UI tells the
 * user the truth even when an env override like `GLYPH_HOME` is in
 * effect.
 *
 * Lives in `@glyphs-ai/contracts` so both the server's `configRoutes`
 * handler and the dashboard / CLI clients can typecheck against the
 * same shape without one package value-importing the other.
 *
 * Sensitive values are NOT exposed: the dashboard runs in single-user
 * mode on the same host as the server, so absolute paths are
 * appropriate.
 *
 * `currentWorkspaceId` reflects the registry's last-selected workspace
 * id at the moment of the request — it's a hint for the dashboard's
 * "open this workspace on first load" UX, not a binding contract.
 *
 * The catalog is per-workspace (lives in each workspace's
 * `workspace.db` as BLOB rows) and is therefore NOT a global config
 * field — it's surfaced by the workspace's metadata endpoint instead.
