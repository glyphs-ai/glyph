/**
 * Public surface of `@glyphs-ai/contracts`.
 *
 * Pure types plus the route manifest (`ROUTES` / `defineRoute`). No
 * orchestration, no DB handles, no subprocess spawning. Safe for the
 * SPA bundle and the CLI alike.
 *
 * Re-exports are grouped by source file rather than by category so the
 * "where does `Foo` live?" answer is one `grep` away. The cross-pkg
 * re-exports in `./domain.ts` cover the domain types that cross the
 * wire (`Agent`, `Skill`, `Schedule`, etc.) so consumers never need
 * a workspace dep on the source pkg.
