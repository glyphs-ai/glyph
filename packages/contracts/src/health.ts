 *
 * Sensitive values are deliberately NOT exposed: the endpoint is
 * unauthenticated so it can serve the dashboard backoff probe before
 * the user has supplied an API key, and so external monitors don't
 * need credentials. Anything you'd hide from a stranger on the
 * network does not belong here.
