/**
 * Wire shape consumed by the dashboard's `ResolveTree` component for
 * the install + sync flows. Lives in `@glyphs-ai/contracts` so both the
 * server's `planToManifest` projection AND the dashboard / CLI
 * clients can typecheck against the same shape without one package
 * value-importing the other.
 *
 * Two-phase install + sync flow:
 *  - Install: dashboard POSTs `/skills/resolve` with `{ origin }` to
 *    preview, then `/skills` to commit.
 *  - Sync: dashboard POSTs `/skills/:fqn/sync/resolve` to preview the
 *    diff for an already-installed entry, then `/skills/:fqn/sync` to
 *    commit. Manifest's `isSync` distinguishes the two flows so the
 *    dashboard can render orphans + identity-change banners only when
 *    they're meaningful.
 *
 * Without this projection, dashboard reads `manifest.nodes` on the raw
 * `CatalogPlan` (which has `toInstall`/`alreadyInstalled`/`conflicts`
 * instead) — that triggers a `findIndex` on `undefined` and the React
 * tree unmounts to a blank page.
