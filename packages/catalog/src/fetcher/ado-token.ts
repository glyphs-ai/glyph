/**
 * Default-token resolution for `AzureDevOpsFetcher`.
 *
 * Two-tier fallback chain — explicit env var first, then `git` credential
 * helper. Designed so the common cases (CI with `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN`, local
 * dev with Git Credential Manager already configured) Just Work without any
 * new glyph configuration:
 *
 *   1. `process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT ?? process.env.AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT
 *      ?? process.env.SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN` — explicit env always wins.
 *      Returned with `{ source: "env" }` so the caller can skip the
 *      `approve`/`reject` round-trip (env tokens have no GCM entry).
 *   2. `git -c credential.useHttpPath=true credential fill` — invoked once
 *      per `(org, repo)` per {@link CACHE_TTL_MS}. The resolver runs a
 *      **silent peek** first (`GCM_INTERACTIVE=Never` + `-c
 *      credential.interactive=false`) so warm-cache calls produce no
 *      sign-in popup AND no stderr noise. Only when the silent peek
 *      returns nothing AND we are NOT in an explicit opt-out environment
 *      (`CI=true` / `GLYPH_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`) does the resolver fall
 *      back to the real interactive fill (which is where a Microsoft
 *      sign-in window may appear); the explicit opt-outs short-circuit
 *      with an escape-hatch {@link FetchError} instead of waiting on the
 *      120s interactive bound.
 *   3. `null` — caller emits an anonymous request. Public ADO repos are
 *      rare, so this typically surfaces as a 401/403 from the upstream
 *      Items API with a sensible error message.
 *
 * Why a process-wide cache keyed on `(org, repo)`: a deep dependency
 * closure can fan out to N item fetches; spawning `git` N times would add
 * ~100-200ms × N on Windows. The cache key includes `repo` because GCM
 * may have different cached credentials per repo, so caching only by host
 * would return the wrong cred. 60s is short enough that a
 * `git credential reject` followed by a refresh is reflected within a
 * minute. Stale entries are also explicitly invalidated by
 * {@link invalidateAdoTokenCache} on 401/403 responses, so the next
 * resolve always re-prompts GCM rather than reusing a known-bad token.
 *
 * Why an in-flight `PENDING` map: without it, N concurrent callers on a
 * cold cache (the tree-fan-out case) would all bypass the cache check
 * before the first resolve completes, each spawning `git credential fill`
 * in parallel, each triggering its own GCM popup. The map collapses the
 * fan-out to a single shared `Promise`. Combined with the tree-mode
 * pre-warm in `AzureDevOpsFetcher.fetchTree`, this is belt-and-braces
 * defence against multiple concurrent GCM sign-in popups for one tree
 * install.
 *
 * Why we never throw on `git` failures: token resolution is best-effort.
 * A `git` failure (binary missing, GCM unconfigured, keyring locked,
 * timeout) must not cascade into "install impossible" — the request
 * always falls through to anonymous, and the upstream HTTP layer surfaces
 * a sensible 401/403 if that turns out to be insufficient.
 *
 * The non-interactive guard now ONLY fast-fails on explicit user
 * opt-outs (`CI=true`, `GLYPH_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`). For all other
 * environments we proceed to interactive fill and trust GCM to decide
 * whether it can render a popup; the spawn is bounded by
 * `SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS_INTERACTIVE` (120s) so a truly stuck popup falls
 * through to anonymous rather than hanging the install indefinitely.
 * Rationale: `process.stdin.isTTY` is the wrong signal for popup
 * renderability (Copilot CLI / VS Code tasks / WSL X-forward all hit
 * false negatives), and GCM already does its own GUI-availability
 * detection more accurately than we can.
