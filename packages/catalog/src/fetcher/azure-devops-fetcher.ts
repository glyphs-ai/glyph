/**
 * Fetcher for `https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_git/<repo>?path=/<path>`
 * URIs (Azure DevOps Services only; on-prem TFS / Azure DevOps Server is
 * rejected at `parseOrigin` time).
 *
 * Two endpoints, both on the **Items API** version `7.1`:
 *
 *  - {@link AzureDevOpsFetcher.fetchFile} — single-file reads use
 *    `GET /_apis/git/repositories/{repo}/items?path={pathEnc}&api-version=7.1`
 *    with `Accept: application/octet-stream`. The response body is the
 *    raw file bytes (ADO sets `Content-Type: application/octet-stream;
 *    api-version=7.1` on success; the `; api-version=...` suffix is
 *    expected and harmless). The resolve path goes here — anchor files
 *    (SKILL.md / AGENTS.md / `<name>.json`) only.
 *
 *  - {@link AzureDevOpsFetcher.fetchTree} — directory installs use
 *    `GET /_apis/git/repositories/{repo}/items?scopePath={pathEnc}
 *    &recursionLevel=Full&api-version=7.1` to list every item under the
 *    scope path in one JSON RTT, filters to entries with
 *    `gitObjectType === "blob"`, then fans out parallel single-file
 *    fetches against the Items API for each blob's `path`. Bounded
 *    worker pool exactly mirrors `GitHubFetcher.fetchTreeViaBlobs`
 *    (stable order, clean error short-circuit).
 *
 *    When the listing returns an empty `value` array (NOT a 404 — ADO
 *    signals "this scope path is not a directory" with an empty value
 *    rather than an HTTP error), the fetcher falls back to a single-
 *    file fetch of `subPath` and yields it under its basename. This
 *    mirrors the single-file subpath branch in `GitHubFetcher` so
 *    consumers see the same `relPath` regardless of which transport ran.
 *
 * **Auth — three-step git credential helper protocol**. The token is
 * resolved once (via {@link resolveDefaultAdoToken}) and the same
 * {@link ResolvedAdoToken} is threaded through every HTTP request the
 * fetcher makes for a single `fetchFile` / `fetchTree` invocation:
 *
 *   1. **`fill`** — `resolveDefaultAdoToken` runs `git credential fill`
 *      (with a silent-peek first) to obtain the credential. Cached
 *      per-`(org, repo)` for 60s in the in-process cache.
 *   2. **HTTP request** with `Authorization: Basic base64(":" + token)`.
 *      ALWAYS Basic, NEVER Bearer: ADO accepts both PATs and Azure AD
 *      JWTs through the same Basic-with-empty-username form, so the
 *      auth layer doesn't need to detect token type.
 *   3. **`approve` on 2xx / `reject` on 401/403** — but ONLY when the
 *      token came from `git credential fill` (`source ===
 *      "git-credential"`). Env-var-sourced tokens have no GCM entry to
 *      confirm/discard. Running `approve` after a successful response is
 *      what makes GCM persist the credential to OS-level storage
 *      (wincredman / keychain / libsecret); without it, GCM treats every
 *      successful fill as untrusted and re-prompts on the next cold
 *      cache. `reject` on 401/403 forces GCM to discard the stale entry,
 *      paired with {@link invalidateAdoTokenCache} so the next resolve
 *      doesn't re-return the same stale token from the in-process cache.
 *      Both calls are fire-and-forget — they never throw, and they
 *      never block the HTTP main path.
 *
 * **Tree-mode single resolve**: `fetchTree` resolves the credential
 * EXACTLY ONCE before fanning out to the bounded worker pool. Workers
 * receive the resolved `cred` and never re-call `resolveDefaultAdoToken`;
 * without that pre-warm, N parallel workers on a cold-cache first run
 * could each trigger a GCM popup (the "8-popup storm" UX failure). The
 * `resolveDefaultAdoToken` resolver also dedupes concurrent callers
 * internally via an in-flight Promise map, but the explicit pre-warm is
 * belt-and-braces: it eliminates the race window regardless.
 *
 * **No ref pinning**: the origin grammar deliberately rejects `&version=`,
 * so every install reads from the repo's default branch at the time of
 * the request. See `origin.ts` and the design doc for the trade-off
 * (ADO's GB / GT / GC ref-prefix grammar isn't modelled here).
 *
 * **50 MB per-file cap**: enforced for any individual blob, matching the
 * GitHub fetcher.
