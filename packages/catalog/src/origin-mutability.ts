/**
 * Origin mutability — single rule for "can the catalog mutate this entry's
 * SQLite-stored content / metadata?".
 *
 * An entry is mutable iff its origin's parsed scheme is in
 * {@link MUTABLE_SCHEMES}. Currently `file:` only — local working
 * copies are mutable; remote-sourced entries (GitHub / Azure DevOps
 * URLs and future registry-backed origins) are read-only mirrors that
 * can only be refreshed from upstream via re-install (which is upsert).
 *
 * Mutation is **catalog-only**: editing a `file:` entry in the
 * dashboard updates the SQLite copy WITHOUT writing back to the
 * origin file. A future `export` flow can write the catalog back to
 * the origin path.
 *
 * Why route through `parseOrigin` instead of a `startsWith("file:")`
 * substring check? Two reasons:
 *   1. The fetcher already owns origin grammar (single source of truth
 *      for what "valid origin" means). A garbled URI that the fetcher
 *      would reject must also be considered immutable here, otherwise
 *      a malformed `file:foo` could slip past mutability gating.
 *   2. Adding a new scheme (e.g. `oci:`) only touches `MUTABLE_SCHEMES`
 *      below, not every call site that does string prefix tests.
 *
 * Calling sites:
 *   - `SkillService.updateAnchor`
 *   - `AgentService.updateAnchor`
 *   - `McpService.updateContent`
 *   - facade `buildSkillEntry` / `buildAgentEntry` / `listMcps` (project
 *     `mutable: boolean` onto the wire POJOs so the dashboard can switch
 *     Edit vs Sync UI without a separate roundtrip)
 *
 * The three services throw {@link ImmutableOriginError} when the check
 * fails; the server route layer maps that error name to HTTP 405.
 *
 * **Future**: when the Fetcher count grows (npm/oci/registry-backed
 * fetchers), consider lifting this into `Fetcher.readonly: boolean` so
 * each fetcher self-declares (and `FileFetcher` can even pre-check
 * `access(W_OK)` to surface "the file is read-only" as immutable). For
 * now a centralized scheme set keeps the policy in one place.
