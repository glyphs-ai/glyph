/**
 * Thrown by the resolve walker when the upstream skill graph contains

 * Glyph does not support cyclic catalog deps; the user must break
 * the cycle in the upstream frontmatter.
 *
 * Why we reject at install/sync time rather than tolerate at runtime:
 * the cascade-status pass (`computeSkillStatus` in the facade) uses
 * recursive memoisation to compute "this entry is blocked because its
 * dep is blocked". With cycles, the inner recursive call sees the
 * outer node mid-computation and has to short-circuit — but caching
 * that short-circuited result poisons downstream callers that asked
 * from outside the cycle. Refusing cycles up-front is cheaper than
 * handling that correctly.
 *
 * `cycle` is the back-edge path from the cycle's entry point through
 * to the offending repeat: e.g. `[fileA, fileB, fileA]` means fileA
 * depends on fileB which depends on fileA. Origins (not fqns) are
 * used because the back-edge may be detected before the upstream
 * anchor at the repeat origin has been parsed (so its fqn isn't
 * known at throw time).

 *
 * Why version? Glyph's authoring contract says any meaningful
 * change to SKILL.md MUST bump `version`; without a bump we treat
 * the file as unchanged. Using version (not a byte hash) keeps the
 * detection in the contract's own vocabulary — a contributor who
 * edited the file without bumping is, by contract, not making a
 * change glyph needs to react to.
