/**
 * Tripwire test for `packages/workflow/src/_engine.ts`.
 *
 * The engine module MUST NOT contain `setInterval` or `setTimeout`.
 * All polling cadence lives inside concrete runner implementations
 * (e.g. `packages/api/src/wiring/workflow-worker-task-runner.ts`).
 *
 * This is a SOURCE-level grep — strings appearing inside JSDoc
 * comments (e.g. "MUST NOT contain `setInterval`") are intentionally
 * suffixed with backticks so they don't match the bare token; the
 * test only flags real call-sites by requiring an opening parenthesis
 * after the token. The matching pattern is restrictive enough that
 * `setIntervalMs` (an opt name) or `pollIntervalMs` won't fire, but
 * a bare `setInterval(...)` or `setTimeout(...)` will.
 *
 * If you need a deferred callback in the engine, do not work around
 * this tripwire — fix the design seam first.
