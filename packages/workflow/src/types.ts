/**
 * Public types for `@glyphs-ai/workflow`.
 *
 * The workflow pkg is a substrate over a closed kind enum: it stores
 * `workflow_nodes` rows with a `{ kind: WorkflowNodeKind, spec: unknown }`
 * envelope and routes every kind-aware operation (validate, dispatch,
 * in-flight check, cancel) through a {@link WorkflowNodeRunner}
 * injected at compose time. The substrate has compile-time knowledge
 * of the kind set (`'coordinator' | 'worker'`) and of kind-aware
 * semantic rules, but does NOT know HOW each kind dispatches or what
 * spec shape each kind requires — those are runner concerns.
 *
 * Per-kind wire DTOs (`WorkflowWorkerNodeSpec`,
 * `WorkflowCoordinatorNodeSpec`, `WorkflowNodeWireSpec`, …) live in
 * `@glyphs-ai/contracts`; this file owns only substrate-side types
 * (`WorkflowNodeKind`, `WorkflowStatus`, `WorkflowNodeStatus`,
 * `WorkflowNodeSpecEnvelope`, `WorkflowNodeValidateCtx`,
 * `WorkflowNodeDispatchOpts`, `WorkflowNodeRunner`,
 * `WorkflowRunners`, and the two derived-view helpers
 * `hasLiveCoord` / `deriveIterationCount`).
