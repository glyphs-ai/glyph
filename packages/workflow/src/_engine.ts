/**
 * `WorkflowEngine` — the in-memory, event-driven tick loop that
 * advances workflows by dispatching ready nodes to per-kind
 * `WorkflowNodeRunner` implementations.
 *
 * # Why no timer?
 *
 * This module contains no `setInterval` or `setTimeout`. Polling
 * cadence is per-host and lives inside the concrete runner
 * implementations (e.g. `workflow-task-runner.ts` polls
 * `tasks.get(...)` to discover terminal status). The engine reacts
 * to two events only:
 *
 *   1. The substrate calls {@link WorkflowEngine.triggerWorkflowTick}
 *      after every mutation tx commits (createWorkflow, addNode,
 *      addEdge, addSubgraph, cancelNode, finishWorkflow,
 *      cancelWorkflow, removeNode, removeEdge, replaceSpec, and
 *      `markNodeTerminal` itself).
 *   2. A runner pushes a terminal outcome back via the `onTerminal`
 *      callback the engine handed it at `dispatch` time; the engine
 *      writes the terminal status via `service.markNodeTerminal`,
 *      which in turn fires (1) again. This is the "ratchet" that
 *      drives a workflow forward.
 *
 * A central interval timer would either tick too fast (wasted DB
 * reads) or too slow (stale state) and would defeat the per-runner
 * polling cadence. By staying purely event-driven, the engine is
 * latency-optimal under the legal-cancellation pattern and the
 * cost of a workflow that's "doing nothing" is exactly zero CPU.
 *
 * The acceptance gate is enforced by `engine-no-timer.test.ts`,
 * which greps this file's source for `setInterval` / `setTimeout`.
 *
 * # Per-workflow serialization
 *
 * Two concurrent triggers on the same workflow could otherwise race
 * `dispatchAtomic` calls + their state-transition writes. The engine
 * serializes per workflow id via a `Map<workflowId, Promise<void>>`
 * chain: each `triggerWorkflowTick` reads the current tail, chains
 * `tickOnce` onto it, and writes the new tail back. The Map is
 * pruned on settle (using `next.finally(...)`) so it does NOT grow
 * with the cumulative count of ever-touched workflows.
 *
 * Cross-workflow ticks run in parallel (each workflow has its own
 * chain), and within a single tick all eligible nodes dispatch in
 * parallel via `Promise.all`.
 *
 * # Engine ↔ service cycle
 *
 * The engine calls into `WorkflowService.dispatchAtomic` and
 * `WorkflowService.markNodeTerminal`. The service calls into
 * `WorkflowEngine.triggerWorkflowTick`. `compose.ts` resolves the
 * cycle with two-phase init: construct the service with no engine,
 * construct the engine with the service, then `service.setEngine(e)`.
 *
 * # State
 *
 * Pure in-memory: a `Map<workflowId, Promise>` chain + a
 * `shuttingDown` flag + the injected deps. No tables, no module-
 * level mutables, no persistence — engine restart = in-flight nodes
 * stuck `running` until a recovery hook lands.
