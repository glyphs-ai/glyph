/**
 * Builds the static portion of the env bag that the server hands to
 * every glyph-spawned subprocess. Per-run additions
 * (`GLYPH_WORKSPACE`, `GLYPH_WORKSPACE_DIR`, `GLYPH_WORK_*`) are
 * layered on top inside `dispatchTask.execute` /
 * `SessionService.assembleLaunchEnv`; this helper is for fields the
 * server itself owns (where to dial back, where the cross-workspace
 * shared state directory lives).
 *
 * Why a dedicated module:
 *   - Keeps `index.ts` focused on Hono wiring instead of env munging.
 *   - The `0.0.0.0` → loopback rewrite has subtle platform behaviour and
 *     deserves its own dedicated unit-test surface
 *     (`test/subprocess-env.test.ts`).
 *
 * Variables emitted (all required, all string-typed):
 *   - GLYPH_SERVER     — `http://<host>:<port>`
 *   - GLYPH_SHARED_DIR — `<GLYPH_HOME>/shared`, the canonical
 *                         cross-workspace state directory. Same path
 *                         the runtime exposes to MCP specs as
 *                         `${sharedDir}`. Agents and skills that need
 *                         "machine-shared writable state" (playwright
 *                         logins re-used across workspaces, model
 *                         caches, …) read this. The service-internal
 *                         `<GLYPH_HOME>` itself (which holds
 *                         `global.db`, `runtime.json`, `logs/`) is
 *                         deliberately NOT exposed — agents have no
 *                         business touching it. See
 *                         {@link SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB_KEYS} for the
 *                         enforcement seam on the headless path.
 *
 * Hostname rewrite: a server bound to `0.0.0.0` accepts connections
 * on every interface, but a child dialing `0.0.0.0` is platform-
 * dependent (Windows refuses outright; *nix conventionally treats it
 * as `127.0.0.1` for outbound). Loopback is the only address
 * guaranteed to work from a same-host child, so we normalise here.
 * `::` (IPv6 wildcard) gets the same treatment for symmetry.
 *
 * No auth env: glyph ships no auth layer (the server binds loopback-
 * only; remote access is delegated to SSH / reverse proxy / mesh VPN).
 * There is therefore no `GLYPH_API_KEY` and no analogue.

/**
 * Env keys that the headless launch path MUST strip from the
 * inherited parent env before handing the child to the SDK. Distinct
 * from {@link buildSubprocessEnvBase} because "set X to Y" and
 * "remove X" are different semantics and only one of them is
 * actionable on every launch path.
 *
 * `GLYPH_HOME`: the server reads `process.env.GLYPH_HOME` to find
 * its own state directory, so the value is in the server's env by
 * construction. Without an explicit scrub, every spawned task would
 * inherit it and could reach into `global.db`, `runtime.json`,
 * `logs/`, etc. — exactly what `GLYPH_SHARED_DIR` was designed to
 * replace. The headless path goes through `mergeEnv` in
 * `packages/runtime/src/copilot/launch-headless.ts`, which honours an
 * `undefined` override as "delete this key from the parent env";
 * `CopilotRuntime.launchHeadless` translates this list into those
 * overrides.
 *
 * Interactive (session-spawned terminal) launches deliberately do NOT
 * apply this scrub: a user-driven shell owns its own env. `cmd /k`
 * and pwsh `$env:` prefixes can only SET values, not unset them, so
 * there is no way to delete an inherited key from inside the shell
 * launcher anyway.
