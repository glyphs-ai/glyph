/**
 * Per-request id middleware.
 *
 * Produces a short, opaque id for every request (used as a correlation
 * key by the request-scoped logger and echoed back in the
 * `x-request-id` response header). When the client supplies its own
 * `x-request-id` header (e.g. a downstream proxy or front-end client
 * already participating in distributed tracing) we honour it as long
 * as it looks reasonable — otherwise we mint a fresh 8-char id.
 *
 * Why 8 chars: long enough to be unique across the volume of
 * concurrent requests a single glyph server sees (single-host, small
 * team), short enough to keep log lines readable. Collision risk is
 * irrelevant in practice — these are per-request, not persisted.
 *
 * Stashed on `c.var.requestId`. Routes can read it via
 * `c.get("requestId")`; the request-scoped logger middleware folds it
 * into every line the route emits.
