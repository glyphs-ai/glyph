/**
 * Bundled binary entry point.
 *
 * The library entry (`./index.ts`) exports `runServer` for direct use;
 * this file is the foreground bin that gets run by
 * `node packages/server/dist/bin.js` (the published binary path before
 * the CLI takes over) and by the local `pnpm dev` workflow. The
 * dashboard is always shipped alongside the server, so we default
 * `--serve-static` ON unless the operator explicitly opts out with
 * `--no-serve-static`.
 *
 * Anything else — port, host, GLYPH_HOME, log level — is still controlled
 * by environment variables and read inside `runServer`.
 *
 * The CLI's `glyph serve` subcommand calls `runServer` directly with
 * the same default and does not go through this file.
