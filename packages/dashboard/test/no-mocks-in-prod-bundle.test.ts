 * bundle. The dynamic `import.meta.env.VITE_USE_MOCKS === "1"` check
 * in `src/main.tsx` is the seam that lets vite tree-shake the whole
 * subtree out when the flag is unset at build time.
 *
 * Runs after `pnpm -F @glyphs-ai/dashboard build`. The test
 * self-skips (warn + early return) when `dist/` is absent so the
 * fast inner-loop `pnpm test` stays fast — CI runs `build && test`
 * sequentially so the bundle is always present when this matters.
