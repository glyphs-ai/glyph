/**
 * Contract pin for `buildOriginFromSource`. Mirrors the CLI's
 * `buildInstallOrigin` guard in `packages/cli/src/commands/catalog.ts`:
 *  - `url` is pass-through (the server's `parseOrigin` picks the fetcher
 *     from the URL grammar).
 *  - `file` prepends `file:` if not already present.
 *  - `url` + a `file:` URI is rejected — the user almost certainly meant
 *     to pick `file`.
