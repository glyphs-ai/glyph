/**
 * Read + guarded-write pair for a single URL search-params value.
 *
 * Sentinel `defaultValue` semantics:
 *   - When the URL omits the key, reads as `defaultValue`.
 *   - When the writer is called with `defaultValue`, the key is
 *     **removed** instead of stored — keeps URLs canonical (no
 *     `?range=7d` cluttering the bar when 7d is also the default).
 *
 * Loop guard: setters compare the incoming value against the current
 * URL value and bail out early when they match. Without this, an
 * effect that calls `setValue(value)` would re-render → re-fire the
 * effect → re-call `setValue(value)` forever (React-Router v6
 * StrictMode reproducibly triggers this in dev when filters are
 * derived during render).
 *
 * The setter rebuilds the new search string from `location.search`
 * (which it re-reads each invocation through the useCallback dep
 * array), then calls `navigate(...)` with an absolute path-and-search
 * string so the router commits the change without going through
 * `useSearchParams`'s captured-snapshot path. The page is responsible
 * for not chaining stale-state writes that would clobber a sibling
 * URL-clear — see `TasksPage`'s `effectiveSelectedId` for the
 * derived-during-render alternative to effect-driven URL writes.
 *
 * `replace: true` is the default history mode — typing into the
 * search box should not create one history entry per keystroke.
 *
 * Used by the Sessions and Tasks pages to keep filters refresh-stable
 * and shareable.
