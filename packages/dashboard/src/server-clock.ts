/**
 * Server-clock-anchored "now" for the dashboard.
 *
 * Every preset filter ("Today", "7d", "30d") computes a cutoff and ships
 * it to the server as `?createdSince=<iso>` (Tasks) or `?activeSince=<iso>`
 * (Sessions). The server compares it lexicographically against
 * `task.createdAt` / `session.lastActiveAt`, which were stamped by the
 * **server's** clock (or the underlying runtime's) at write time.
 *
 * If the dashboard uses raw `Date.now()` and the user's laptop clock has
 * drifted (NTP off, manual time change, sleep-resume skew, phone-on-LAN
 * different timezone), the cutoff straddles entries the user expected
 * to see — silently. "Today" can hide today's tasks. "7d" can include
 * older rows or miss newer ones.
 *
 * This module syncs the offset between client and server clocks via
 * `/api/health` (which echoes its own `serverNow`) once at boot and
 * refreshes periodically. Callers compute presets against `serverNow()`
 * (local clock plus the cached offset) so cutoffs match what the server
 * actually sees, regardless of the user's local clock state.
 *
 * Single-instance, module-level state. Not React-reactive: filter
 * presets are evaluated at click time, so the latest cached offset is
 * applied without needing a re-render of consumers.
