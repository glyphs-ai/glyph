/**
 * Scroll container that follows the bottom of its content while the
 * user has scrolled to (or near) the bottom — matches how chat apps
 * (Slack, Cursor agent, browser DevTools console) keep the latest
 * line visible during live activity, without yanking the user's
 * position when they've scrolled up to read history.
 *
 * Three effects:
 *
 * 1. **Reset effect** (keyed by `resetKey`): when the user switches
 *    tasks, jump to the bottom unconditionally.
 * 2. **Follow effect** (keyed by `followKey`): each time a new tail
 *    event arrives, if the user is currently pinned to the bottom,
 *    scroll the new content into view. Otherwise leave their viewport
 *    position alone.
 * 3. **Top-anchor effect** (keyed by `topAnchorKey`): when older
 *    history is prepended (the first item's seq decreases), the
 *    naive behavior is to keep `scrollTop` constant — but the content
 *    the user was reading shifts DOWN by the height of the prepended
 *    block. We compensate by adding `(newScrollHeight - oldScrollHeight)`
 *    to `scrollTop`. Only runs when the user has scrolled away from
 *    the bottom.
 *
 * `useLayoutEffect` avoids the visible one-frame jump that would
 * otherwise show the un-scrolled state before the autoscroll runs.
 *
 * The bottom-detection has a 4px tolerance for subpixel rounding.
