 * each caller destructures its own record into this prop bag.
 *
 * `status` is typed open (`string`) on purpose: the only value the
 * branching logic looks at is the literal "running" — every other
 * status falls through to the terminal/created branches. Keeping it
 * open avoids forcing this helper to depend on either consumer's

/**
 * Smart relative-time line shared by row-level meta sentences across
 * Tasks and Workflows. Shows the most informative timestamp for each
 * lifecycle stage:
 *   - running with `startedAt`: "running for 1m 23s" (live elapsed
 *     from start)
 *   - terminal with `startedAt` + `endedAt`: "ran 5m 12s · ended 2h
 *     ago"
 *   - any other shape (queued, terminal-without-start, etc.):
 *     "created X ago" against `createdAt` — the only timestamp every
 *     record is guaranteed to carry.
 *
 * Tooltip carries the absolute timestamp for forensic precision.
 *
 * The branching logic lives here exactly once — call sites pass
 * discrete props rather than a record so the helper is independent
 * of the Task/Workflow record types. `TaskListItem` and
 * `WorkflowListItem` invoke this shared component directly instead of
 * carrying page-specific wrappers.
