/**
 * Compact meta-stats segment for the workflow detail header:
 * `Created · Ended · Duration · Phases`.
 *
 * Renders a fragment of `<span>` elements designed to slot into the
 * shared `.task-detail__statbar` flex row alongside Tasks' canonical
 * `Runtime · Started · …` siblings (see `TaskView.tsx` for the
 * parallel). Each stat uses the same `.task-detail__statbar-key`
 * label + value shape so the row reads visually identical to a Tasks
 * detail header.
 *
 * The coordinator agent lives in the header `meta-row` alongside the
 * status badge (mirroring the
 * here would be redundant.
 *
 * "Phases" renders the workflow's progress as `current / total`,
 * 1-indexed for display so the first phase of a 3-phase DAG reads as
 * `1 / 3` (matching the "step X of Y" / "page X of Y" convention used
 * elsewhere in the dashboard). Internally the active-phase index is
 * 0-indexed everywhere — only the display string carries the `+ 1`.
 *
 * `current` is the lowest phase that still has work to do (any
 * `not_started` / `ready` / `running` node), or the last phase value
 * once every node is terminal. `total` is the count of distinct
 * phases in the DAG (max phase value + 1). The fully-completed case
 * therefore renders as `total / total` (e.g. `3 / 3`), which a user
 * correctly reads as "all phases done".
 *
 * The Phases stat is omitted entirely while the DAG is still loading
 * (`dag === null`) and ALSO while the DAG has zero nodes — the latter
 * happens in the brief window between workflow creation and the
 * coordinator extending the DAG, when a `0 / 0` rendering would be
 * meaningless to the user. This matches the dashboard's broader
 * "omit when not yet known" pattern (e.g. the `Ended` stat is omitted
 * while a workflow is still running).
 *
 * The `current` value is derived client-side from the DAG snapshot
 * already in hand; the workflow header wire intentionally avoids
 * computing it to keep list reads from fanning out across every DAG.
