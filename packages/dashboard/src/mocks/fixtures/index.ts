/**
 * Barrel re-export for the MSW fixture suite. Importers go through
 * here so handlers.ts stays decoupled from the per-resource fixture
 * file layout, and so the `artifactBodies` initialiser (which needs
 * top-level `await` to inline binary bodies) lives in exactly one
 * place.
 *
 * Tree-shaking note: this file (and the entire `mocks/` folder) is
 * only reachable through the dynamic import in `src/main.tsx`
 * guarded by `import.meta.env.VITE_USE_MOCKS`. With the flag unset
 * at build time, vite drops the entire subtree from the prod bundle
 * (the build-canary test in `test/no-mocks-in-prod-bundle.test.ts`
 * pins that guarantee).
