/**
 * Resolve an agent name to a runnable `ResolvedAgent` via the agent
 * resolver port. Performs the cascade-aware status check — refuses
 * dispatch on blocked agents (prereqs not acknowledged, agent
 * disabled, or any transitive skill missing/blocked). Throws
 * `AgentNotFoundError` for unknown agents (`getAgentEntry` returns
 * null), `EntryNotReadyError` for blocked entries, and
 * `AgentResolutionFailedError` (500) for unexpected resolver faults.
 *
 * Discrimination is via `null` return from `getAgentEntry` + generic
 * catch on `resolveAgent`; the port deliberately does NOT expose an
 * "agent not found" error class — any thrown error from
 * `resolveAgent` is classified as a 500. TOCTOU note: an agent
 * disappearing between `getAgentEntry` and `resolveAgent` surfaces
 * as `AgentResolutionFailedError` (500) rather than
 * `AgentNotFoundError` (400) — accepted as vanishingly rare in
 * practice.
