/**
 * Shared utilities for the SPLIT sub-layout of `task-service.ts`.
 * Leading underscore marks this file as a private utility module
 * (NOT a SPLIT peer) per the pkg-template convention. Cross-cutting
 * helpers (`LiveTask`, `decideTerminal`, `applyTerminal`, `safeRm`)
 * live here so the sibling concern modules do not need to reach into
 * each other for shared types or functions.
 *
 * ## `task-service/` SPLIT layout convention
 *
 * **Leaf modules** — `activity-stream.ts`, `agent-resolver.ts`,
 * `dispatch.ts`, `queries.ts`, and `shutdown.ts` — import only from
 * `./_helpers.js` and the parent `../task-service.js` index. They
 * MUST NOT import each other, and they MUST NOT import
 * `./mutations.js`.
 *
 * **Orchestrator exception** — `mutations.ts` is the single
 * exception: it sits at the top of the sub-layout DAG and wires
 * `dispatch.ts` + `agent-resolver.ts` together for the
 * dispatch / cancel / delete lifecycle. As the orchestrator it
 * imports from sibling modules deliberately; nothing reverse-imports
 * `mutations.ts`, so the graph stays acyclic (orchestrator →
 * orchestrated, never the reverse).
 *
 * **Why not route the orchestrator through `_helpers.ts`?** Two
 * unattractive alternatives:
 *
 *   - Re-export the `dispatch` / `agent-resolver` surface from
 *     `_helpers.ts`. Pure indirection with no benefit, and
 *     `_helpers` would no longer be a leaf utility.
 *   - Collapse `mutations.ts` back into a flat module. Defeats the
 *     SPLIT trigger (>= 600 LOC AND >= 3 cohesive concerns) that
 *     justified carving the subdir out in the first place.
 *
 * The orchestrator pattern keeps the DAG acyclic AND the cohesive
 * split intact.
