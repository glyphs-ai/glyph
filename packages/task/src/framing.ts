/**
 * File-based task brief + details contract.
 *
 * The Task layer materializes the user-supplied `brief` (+ optional
 * `details`) to a file inside the task workdir (`TASK.md`) and creates
 * two empty agent-managed subdirectories (`temp/` for scratch,
 * `artifact/` for user-visible output). The runtime then receives
 * only a short, fixed ASCII framing prompt that points the agent at
 * those files.
 *
 * Why: on Windows, `cmd.exe` treats LF inside a `/c` payload as a
 * statement separator. Any user-supplied LF in the spawn argv would
 * truncate the copilot CLI's argument list, dropping
 * `--output-format json`, `--session-id`, `--allow-all` etc., causing
 * silent task degradation. Moving user bytes out of argv eliminates
 * that class of bug entirely — the framing prompt is a fixed
 * single-line ASCII string we author ourselves, so there are no
 * user-controlled bytes in argv ever.
 *
 * The runtime layer remains unchanged: it still receives `prompt` as
 * a single argv element via {@link import("@glyphs-ai/runtime").LaunchHeadlessOpts}.
 * Only the *value* changes — from the user-supplied bytes to a fixed
 * framing prompt that tells the agent to read TASK.md.
