/**
 * cancel-during-shutdown: fire shutdown() and cancel() concurrently
 * for a live task. The outcome is non-deterministic: shutdown might
 * flip the `shuttingDown` flag before cancel() takes its check, or
 * cancel might pass the check first. Either outcome is correct as
 * long as:
 *   - the persisted status is one of {cancelled, failure(kind:cascade)}
 *   - cancel() either resolves to a cancelled TaskEntity, OR
 *   - cancel() rejects with ManagerShuttingDownError (shutdown won before
 *     cancel's pre-check), OR
 *   - cancel() rejects with InvalidTransition (cancel passed the
 *     pre-check, but by the time it dropped into the live-kill block
 *     shutdown had already claimed the kill via `killReason='shutdown'`
 *     — the `wasFirstToCancel` guard then throws against the
 *     finalised terminal status).
 *
 * Test passes if BOTH the persisted status and the cancel() outcome
 * match one of these documented combinations.
