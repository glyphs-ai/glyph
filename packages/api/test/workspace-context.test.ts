/**
 * Pinned race-semantics tests for the internal
 * `WorkspaceContextRegistry`. The class is exported from
 * `workspace-context.ts` but NOT re-exported on the package barrel;
 * this file imports it via the relative path so the pkg-internal
 * contract stays testable without widening the public surface.
 *
 * Two scenarios:
 *
 *   1. `closeAll()` drains an inflight `get()` before disposing.
 *      Without the drain a concurrent load resolves after closeAll
 *      clears the map, leaving the freshly-built context in the
 *      `entries` map past process exit.
 *
 *   2. `load()`'s cleanup stack runs in reverse on a thrown
 *      `composeScheduleModule`. The previously-built catalog /
 *      session / task modules must each have `close()` called in
 *      reverse-of-compose order so SQLite handles + WAL pins don't
 *      leak on the failure path.
 *
 * Both tests mock the per-BC `compose*Module` functions and
 * `node:fs/promises.mkdir` so the registry exercises its lifecycle
 * paths without touching disk or any real BC code.
