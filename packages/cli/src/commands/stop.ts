/**
 * `glyph stop` — read `runtime.json`, send SIGTERM to the recorded pid,
 * wait for the process to exit (graceful-shutdown handler in the server
 * does the heavy lifting), escalate to SIGKILL if the grace period
 * elapses, then delete `runtime.json`.
 *
 * Idempotent: a missing file or a dead pid both surface as success
 * (with a note when we cleaned up a stale breadcrumb).
 *
 * Windows note: `process.kill(pid, signal)` on Windows is mapped to
 * `TerminateProcess` regardless of the signal name — there is no
 * graceful equivalent of POSIX SIGTERM. The server's
 * `gracefulShutdown` handler therefore will NOT run on Windows. The
 * server's persistence is SQLite (WAL + transactions), which means
 * mid-write torn writes don't corrupt the DB even on hard kill;
 * in-flight task subprocesses can still be orphaned and are cleaned
 * up on the next server boot via the `recoverOrphaned` sweep.
