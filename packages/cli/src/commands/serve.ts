/**
 * `glyph serve` — run the HTTP server in the foreground.
 *
 * The `glyph` binary is *both* the client CLI and the server bundle:
 * client subcommands (`task list`, `catalog agent install`, …) speak
 * HTTP to a running server, and `serve` is the entry point that boots
 * that server in-process. `glyph start` is just `spawn("glyph serve",
 * { detached: true })` plus a `/api/health` wait — same bin, different
 * lifecycle.
 *
 * That's why this file is the one place in `@glyphs-ai/cli` allowed to
 * value-import from `@glyphs-ai/server`: this *is* the server boot path.
 * Every other cli↔server interaction goes over HTTP through
 * `api-client.ts` using wire contracts from `@glyphs-ai/contracts`.
 *
 * This function does NOT return — once the server is listening, the
 * process stays alive on the open http handle until SIGTERM / SIGINT
 * triggers `runServer`'s graceful shutdown.
