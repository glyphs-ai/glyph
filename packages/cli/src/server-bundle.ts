/**
 * Resolve the path to the bundled CLI binary (== bundled server) so
 * `start` can spawn it as a detached child with a `serve` subcommand.
 *
 * In the published `@glyphs-ai/glyph` package, the CLI and the
 * server are baked into the same `bundle/glyph.js` file (esbuild
 * inlines both). At runtime the CLI is the entry; `process.argv[1]`
 * gives that path.
 *
 * In source / monorepo dev (running the CLI via tsx), `process.argv[1]`
 * still points at the script the node executable was launched with
 * (`packages/cli/src/bin.ts`); the caller is then responsible for
 * passing `nodeArgs` like `["--import", "tsx"]` to `start` so the
 * spawned child can load the TS source.
