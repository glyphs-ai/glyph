/**
 * In-process CLI invoker for argv-layer and api-contract tests.
 *
 * Calls `run(argv)` from `../../src/index.ts` directly (no spawn, no
 * server) while capturing every byte written to `process.stdout` /
 * `process.stderr` and applying scoped env overrides. Restores both
 * streams + env on return so concurrent tests can't leak state.
 *
 * Why not spawn: the historical `commands.test.ts` paid a full
 * `node bin.js` cold-start (~50–200 ms) per case, even for ones that
 * only checked argv parsing. Going in-process drops each case to a
 * handful of milliseconds, keeping argv-layer tests cheap and focused.
 *
 * Why not a global fetch reset: callers that need a mock fetch should
 * stub it themselves with `vi.spyOn(globalThis, "fetch")` and restore
 * via `vi.restoreAllMocks()` / `mockRestore()`. Keeping the fetch
 * lifecycle outside this helper means argv-only tests don't pay for
 * a stub they don't use.
