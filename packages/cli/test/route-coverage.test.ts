/**
 * Route-coverage drift guard.
 *
 * The route-manifest test on the server side asserts that every Hono
 * handler is in `ROUTES` and vice versa. That guarantees the **server**
 * side of the contract has no orphan routes — but it says nothing
 * about whether the **CLI** actually consumes them. This test prevents
 * catalog sync / acknowledge-prereqs / agent enable-disable style
 * omissions from reaching users unnoticed.
 *
 * This test closes that gap. For every key in `ROUTES`, we require at
 * least one `client.call(...)` or `client.callRaw(...)` invocation in
 * `packages/cli/src/**` referencing it. Adding a new route to the
 * manifest without wiring up a CLI command will fail this test until
 * a wrapper exists in `commands/`.
 *
 * If a route is intentionally NOT exposed to the CLI (e.g. a future
 * dashboard-only or MCP-only surface), add it to {@link ALLOWED_GAPS}
 * with a comment explaining why. The list is intentionally empty
 * today — every shipped route has a CLI consumer.
