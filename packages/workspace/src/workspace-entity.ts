/**
 * Domain entity for `@glyphs-ai/workspace`. Pkg-owned plain interface
 * (no methods — workspace has no domain behaviour beyond CRUD).
 *
 * Layer position:
 *   - `WorkspaceRow` (schema.ts)        — Drizzle ORM shape; private
 *   - `WorkspaceEntity` (this file)     — pkg-owned domain shape;
 *                                          what `WorkspaceRepository`
 *                                          returns. Mirrors row
 *                                          today but is contractually
 *                                          ours: swapping ORM doesn't
 *                                          touch this name.
 *   - `Workspace` (types.ts)            — wire DTO; what
 *                                          `WorkspaceService` returns.
 *                                          Normalises `lastOpenedAt`
 *                                          from nullable to required.
 *
 * Not re-exported from `index.ts`: external consumers only see the
 * `Workspace` DTO. The repository and service both live inside the
 * pkg, so they share the entity type internally.
 *
 * No class wrapper: workspace has no state machine and no invariants
 * beyond what Drizzle + SQLite enforce at the row boundary (zod
 * lives one layer up at the service input boundary, not on the row).
 * A class with only fields and no methods would just add boilerplate.
 * If workspace ever grows domain behaviour (e.g. a `markArchived`
 * transition), convert this file to a class with that behaviour.
