# Service package template

This document describes the standard layout every BC-owning service
package in glyph follows. Examples in-tree: `@glyphs-ai/workspace`,
`@glyphs-ai/session`, `@glyphs-ai/task`, `@glyphs-ai/catalog`,
`@glyphs-ai/schedule`, `@glyphs-ai/workflow` (`@glyphs-ai/schedule` is the
cleanest recent example of the template applied to a new package).

## Known exceptions

Not every package in the repo is a BC-owning service. The following
packages intentionally diverge from this template; none of them carry
their own schema / service / repository / drizzle module:

| Package                  | Role                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@glyphs-ai/contracts`   | Types-only: wire shapes, route catalog, pure path helpers. No runtime.     |
| `@glyphs-ai/runtime`     | Runtime adapter registry (`copilot`, ...).                                 |
| `@glyphs-ai/terminal`    | Thin PTY / shell wrapper: spawn / quoting / platform primitives.           |
| `@glyphs-ai/api`         | Composition root that wires T0 / T1 modules into per-workspace contexts.   |
| `@glyphs-ai/server`      | Transport adapter: Hono routes + middleware over the api composition.     |
| `@glyphs-ai/cli`         | Surface: command registrars over the typed HTTP client.                    |
| `@glyphs-ai/dashboard`   | Surface: browser SPA (Vite + React); tests use MSW.                       |
| `@glyphs-ai/e2e`         | Tests-only: no `src/`, no published API.                                   |

Each package's README states its tier; consult that and this table
rather than asking each README to restate its divergence.

## Scaffold a new service package

```bash
pnpm new-pkg <pkg-name> <EntityName> <table_name>
# e.g.
pnpm new-pkg notebook Note notes
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @glyphs-ai/notebook db:generate
pnpm --filter @glyphs-ai/notebook test
```

The scaffolder copies `packages/_template/`, substitutes the placeholder
tokens (`__PKG__` / `__Entity__` / `__entity__` / `__entities__`), and
deletes the placeholder migration so drizzle-kit can regenerate it from
your schema.

  tsconfig.typecheck.json      typecheck-only config covering src/ + test/
  vitest.config.ts
```

## Typecheck configuration

Every pkg ships a dedicated `tsconfig.typecheck.json` that broadens
`include` to cover both `src/**/*` and `test/**/*`. The `typecheck`
script invokes `tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json`; the file extends
`./tsconfig.json` (the build config) and overrides only what's
needed for a typecheck-only pass:

```jsonc
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmit": true,
    "rootDir": "."
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "test/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

**Why split out a typecheck config**: `vitest run` uses esbuild
transpile-only — type errors in `.test.ts` files never surface during
a test run. Without a typecheck pass over `test/`, real type errors
(like passing `undefined` to a field whose type forbids it under
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) accumulate silently.

**Why `noEmit: true` in the config (not just on the CLI)**: lets
callers run `tsc -p tsconfig.typecheck.json` without remembering to
pass `--noEmit`. Bare `tsc` on this config refuses to emit; you can't
accidentally write `.d.ts` or `.js` into `dist/` from a typecheck
step.

**Pkgs that diverge**: `packages/dashboard` keeps the same script
shape but its `tsconfig.typecheck.json` uses `"include": ["src",
"test"]` (no `rootDir`, no `exclude`) — Vite's module-resolution
settings make the backend-style options unsafe to copy verbatim.
`packages/e2e` uses `"include": ["test/**/*"]` (no `src/**/*`)
because it has no `src/`.

## Test layout convention

Every `packages/<pkg>/test/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` file's location is
determined mechanically by its source imports. Enforced by
`packages/e2e/test/architecture/test-layout-convention.test.ts`.

**The rule**: for each test file, collect every non-type value-import
that resolves to a file under the same package's `src/` tree (resolve
relative to the test file's directory; exclude type-only imports,
`vi.mock(...)`, `vi.importActual(...)`, and imports of other workspace
packages or node builtins).

1. **Zero in-pkg value-imports** → flat at `test/<name>.test.{ts,tsx}`
   (cross-cutting / e2e / fs-walk audits).
2. **All value-imports share a common subdirectory under `src/`
   strictly deeper than `src/` itself** → MUST live at
   `test/<that-subdir>/<name>.test.{ts,tsx}`.
3. **Multiple value-imports with no common subdir below `src/`** →
   flat at `test/<name>.test.{ts,tsx}`.

Type-only imports (`import type { Foo } from "..."` and the `type`
modifier inside mixed `import { type Foo, bar }` specifiers) compile
away and do NOT count. `vi.mock("...")` and `vi.importActual("...")`
are harness, not subject, and do NOT count. Side-effect-only
`import "x"` DOES count — it executes top-level code.

**When source moves, tests move.** If `src/utils/x.ts` is relocated
to `src/x.ts`, the rule's verdict changes and the test must be
relocated in the same PR. The enforcement test fails until both
halves are in sync.

**Allowlisting**: a test whose actual location diverges from the
rule's required location but has a documented reason (umbrella
reflection test, in-flight migration, pre-existing per-area subdir
whose imports happen to span sibling top-level src files) may be
added to `ALLOWED_FLAT_EXCEPTIONS` with a one-line rationale. The
audit asserts the allowlist contains no stale entries (file gone) and
no idle entries (cases where the rule would now pass without an exception).

For worked-out classification examples and the parser self-tests, see
`packages/e2e/test/architecture/test-layout-convention.test.ts`.

## File naming convention

> See [docs/architecture.md § Per-package src layout](./architecture.md#per-package-src-layout) for the full rationale.

**Files exposing a class get an `<entity>-<role>.ts` prefix**:

| file pattern | exports |
|---|---|
| `<entity>-service.ts` | `<Entity>Service` |
| `<entity>-repository.ts` | `<Entity>Repository` |
| `<entity>-entity.ts` | `<Entity>Entity` |

**Utility / glue files use bare role names** (no entity prefix):

`errors.ts`, `types.ts`, `validate.ts`, `schema.ts`, `paths.ts`, `compose.ts`,
`testing.ts`, `index.ts`, `projection.ts`, `plan-types.ts`,
`framing.ts`, `format.ts`.

Rationale: TypeScript imports always carry the full path, so file names
are the grep / IDE token for class location. NestJS, Cal.com, VS Code,
TypeORM, etc. all prefix the class-bearing files. Single-entity packages
in glyph (workspace, session, task) still prefix to keep the
convention uniform across the monorepo.

## Package-private utility files

Files and subdirs whose names start with `_` are package-private
utilities — pure functions, type aliases, or test factories that
the pkg uses internally but does NOT export. The convention is
enforced by `packages/e2e/test/architecture/split-convention.test.ts`,
which skips `_*` files when checking SPLIT compliance (they are
allowed to be siblings of the facade without being delegates).

Canonical names:

- `_helpers.ts` — pure helper functions specific to a single facade
  or module. Used by `task/src/task-service/_helpers.ts`,
  `schedule/src/_helpers.ts`.
- `_shared.ts` — pure helpers shared across multiple files within
  the same pkg or subdir. Used by `terminal/src/_shared.ts`.
- `_<topic>.ts` — a package-private module grouping one cohesive
  slice of internal logic that is too big to inline in the service
  but is not part of the public surface. Named for the concern, not a
  generic "helpers" bucket. Examples: `workflow/src/_dag.ts` (DAG
  topology + readiness), `workflow/src/_engine.ts` (the in-memory tick
  loop), `workflow/src/_dispatch.ts` (per-kind runner dispatch), and
  `workflow/src/_stuck-recovery.ts` (the stuck-coord retry cap). These
  let a large facade (`workflow-service.ts`) delegate to focused
  modules while keeping them out of the barrel.
- `_<topic>/` — package-private subdir grouping related helpers
  (e.g. `catalog/src/_shared/` groups DI plumbing helpers).

Files starting with `_` are not re-exported from `index.ts` **as
modules** — the barrel never does `export * from "./_x.js"`, and a `_`
file never becomes a second public entry point. A `_<topic>.ts` MAY,
however, own a small number of genuinely-public *value consts* (e.g.
an operational cap such as `workflow/src/_stuck-recovery.ts`'s
`STUCK_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` / `STUCK_RETRY_LIMIT`) that the barrel
re-exports by name; the module's functions and types stay internal.
Prefer `types.ts` for broadly-public types — reach for a named const
re-export from a `_` module only when the const is inseparable from
the internal concern that owns it.

Tests for `_` files live alongside the helper they cover
(`test/_helpers.test.ts` is a valid layout per § "Test layout
convention" rule 2).

## Where DTOs live

> See [docs/architecture.md § The three layers](./architecture.md#the-three-layers) for the Row / Entity / DTO split that motivates the single `types.ts` rule.

**ALL public types — DTOs, option shapes, enums, union types — live in
`types.ts`.** Every package has one, regardless of size.

Other files must NOT `export interface` or `export type` consumer-facing
types. The exceptions are:
- `schema.ts` MAY define `<Entity>Row` (Drizzle `$inferSelect` alias)
  but the type is **package-private** — never re-exported from
  `index.ts` even via `export * as schema`. See "Repository contract"
  below.
- `errors.ts` exports Error subclasses (classes are values, not pure types)
- `<entity>-entity.ts` exports the class (a value) for rich-domain BCs
- Multi-entity BCs' `facade/plan-types.ts` may export facade-internal types
- `ports.ts` exports capability interfaces declared by the consumer
  (e.g. `AgentResolverPort`, `SpawnFn`). The port surface is a
  cross-pkg seam, distinct from runtime DTOs that flow over HTTP
  or through the service. See `packages/session/src/ports.ts` and
  `packages/task/src/ports.ts`.
- `compose.ts` MAY export `<Entity>Module` and `<Entity>ModuleOptions`
  alongside `compose<Entity>Module`. These are composition surface
  (how downstream packages WIRE the pkg), distinct from runtime DTOs
  (what flows over HTTP / through the service). The template's own
  `compose.ts` follows this shape.

This rule prevents the "where do I find the `Workspace` interface" drift
that plagued glyph before (DTOs scattered across `service.ts`,
`schema.ts`, and ad-hoc helper files). Every pkg — single-entity or
multi-entity — uses the same filename: `types.ts`.

## Type placement (which package owns this type?)

> See [docs/architecture.md § The three layers](./architecture.md#the-three-layers) for the Row / Entity / DTO split inside one package. This section covers the orthogonal question: *which package* should host a given type.

The "Where DTOs live" section above governs *intra-package* type layout
(one `types.ts` per pkg). This section governs *inter-package* type
layout — given a new type, which of glyph's three type-owning location
kinds should host it.

The monorepo has three kinds of type-owning location. Use this decision
tree in order:

| Kind of type | Lives in | One-line test |
|---|---|---|
| A single BC's entity / DTO / error / option shape | the owning domain pkg's `types.ts` / `errors.ts` | "Does it belong to one BC only? Would you delete it if you deleted that BC?" |
| HTTP wire contract OR cross-package path / route constant the surfaces need at compile time | `@glyphs-ai/contracts` | "Will it appear in a Network tab payload, OR is it a pure type / side-effect-free constant the dashboard / cli reaches for?" |
| In-process composition / runtime container holding live service instances or callbacks | `@glyphs-ai/api` | "Does it own `Promise<Service>` / a `(c) => Service` resolver, OR a cross-BC composition shape constructed once per workspace?" |
| HTTP-transport-internal type (`Hono.Context`-flavoured, route-resolver, middleware) | `@glyphs-ai/server` | "Does its signature reference `Hono.Context`, request bodies, or Express-style middleware?" |

### Decision rules (sharp edges)

1. **Types crossing the public boundary → `@glyphs-ai/contracts`. Cross-BC composition / live-instance shapes → `@glyphs-ai/api`.**
   The 0.6.0 split separates the two: `@glyphs-ai/contracts` holds
   wire types + path helpers (pure types, side-effect-free
   constants, zero orchestration), and `@glyphs-ai/api` holds the
   composition root that wires T0/T1 into per-workspace contexts.
   `@glyphs-ai/api` re-exports the contracts barrel so the in-process
   server can import both via a single specifier; the fenced
   consumers (`@glyphs-ai/dashboard`, `@glyphs-ai/cli`) MUST go through
   `@glyphs-ai/contracts` directly. Domain pkgs can `import type` from
   `@glyphs-ai/contracts` when projecting their internal DTOs to wire
   shape — the inverse (a contracts file importing values from a
   domain pkg) is also fine because contracts is type-only and the
   value graph stays clean.

2. **Single domain's entity / DTO / error → that domain's pkg, never `api` or `contracts`.**
   If `Task` only makes sense as part of the task BC, it lives in
   `packages/task/src/types.ts`. `@glyphs-ai/contracts` re-exports the
   subset of domain types that actually appear on the HTTP wire
   (it depends on the domain pkgs for the type-only re-export). The
   server / cli `import { type Task } from "@glyphs-ai/contracts"`,
   the domain pkg owns the definition. `@glyphs-ai/api` owns
   *cross-BC composition* types only — never single-domain DTOs.

3. **Transport-specific glue → `server` (or the future transport pkg), never `api`.**
   A type whose signature mentions `Hono.Context`, `Request`, `Response`,
   or a route function is HTTP-specific and belongs in `server`. Promote
   to `api` only when a second transport (CLI direct-mode, MCP, gRPC)
   actually arrives and needs the same abstraction generically.
   *Premature generification is the bigger sin than late generification
   here.*

4. **Inter-domain-pkg dependencies must be `import type` ONLY.**
   `task` may `import type` from `catalog` (e.g. `AgentResolveResult`)
   because it talks to catalog *through a service-instance threaded by
   `@glyphs-ai/api`*. It must NOT value-import from `catalog` — that
   would couple two BCs at runtime and violate the "api is the only
   composer" invariant. Enforced mechanically by
   `packages/e2e/test/architecture/inter-service-imports.test.ts`.

5. **Surface (`dashboard`, `cli`) imports go through `@glyphs-ai/contracts`.**
   The fenced consumers MUST NOT import from `@glyphs-ai/api`, any T0
   pkg, or any T1 pkg. Their entire glyph-workspace surface is
   `@glyphs-ai/contracts` (plus, for `cli`, `@glyphs-ai/server` for the
   in-process server boot — the cli binary IS the server bundle).
   Enforced mechanically by
   `packages/e2e/test/architecture/tier-invisibility.test.ts`.

### Corollaries

- **Wire types vs domain types: when they diverge.** A domain pkg's
  internal `XxxEntity` and the wire `Xxx` DTO drift over time
  (`createdAt: Date` → `createdAt: string`, soft-delete fields hidden).
  When that happens, the wire shape moves to `@glyphs-ai/contracts`;
  the entity stays in the domain. The service in the domain pkg owns
  the projection.

- **Errors that cross the wire.** If an error name appears in an HTTP
  error response (i.e. the client branches on it), its `name` literal
  is wire-shape and should be re-declared in `@glyphs-ai/contracts`. The
  Error *class* stays in the domain pkg's `errors.ts`. Cross-pkg
  consumers that need to discriminate the error should branch on
  `err.name === "AgentNotFoundError"` rather than `import`ing the
  class for `instanceof` — the latter introduces a runtime cross-BC
  dep that rule 4 forbids.

- **Resolvers (`(c: Hono.Context) => Service`) stay in `server`.**
  Their parameter type is HTTP-specific; promoting to `api` would
  require introducing a generic `ServiceResolver<RequestCtx, Service>`,
  which has no second consumer today.

- **Avoid pure-rename facades.** A file in pkg X that does nothing but
  `export type Foo = OriginalFoo` from pkg Y is a refactoring smell:
  it suggests either (a) X needs to own Foo for real (move the
  definition), or (b) consumers should import directly from Y (delete
  the facade).

### Pitfalls observed in real PRs

- Putting a wire shape in the originating domain pkg "because it's
  defined there" — couples the wire to the domain. **Fix:** move it
  to `@glyphs-ai/contracts`; have the domain pkg `import type` it for
  projection.

- Putting an in-process resolver type in `@glyphs-ai/api` "because it's
  used by routes" — pollutes the api pkg with `Hono.Context`.
  **Fix:** keep in `server`.

- Adding a type to `@glyphs-ai/api` or `@glyphs-ai/contracts` "because
  multiple downstreams use it" when it's actually a single-domain
  concept — bloats T2. **Fix:** put it in the owning domain pkg;
  re-export from `@glyphs-ai/contracts` only if it genuinely appears
  in a Network-tab payload.

- A domain pkg value-importing another domain pkg's service or error
  class — silently builds a runtime cross-BC dep. **Fix:** use
  `import type`; thread the live instance through `@glyphs-ai/api`'s
  composer; for cross-BC error discrimination, branch on `err.name`
  instead of `instanceof`. Mechanically audited by
  `inter-service-imports.test.ts`.

## Splitting big files via facade + sibling subdir

### When to split

Default: keep one file per `<entity>-<role>.ts` (see naming convention above).

Split a single file ONLY when BOTH conditions hold:

1. The file is **≥ 600 LOC**.
2. The file genuinely contains **≥ 3 cohesive sub-concerns** (e.g. queries vs mutations vs lifecycle vs streaming).

A pure 800-LOC validator (one concern) does NOT split. A 400-LOC service touching 5 concerns does NOT split (too small). A 700-LOC service with reads / writes / lifecycle / streaming DOES split.

### Layout: facade + sibling subdir

```
packages/<pkg>/src/
  <entity>-<role>.ts          ← facade (public entry, ≤ ~250 LOC)
  <entity>-<role>/            ← subdir; basename MUST equal facade basename
    <concern-1>.ts            ← bare concern name; no entity prefix needed
    <concern-2>.ts
    …
```

Canonical reference implementation: `packages/task/src/task-service.ts` +
`packages/task/src/task-service/` — the split-layout convention introduced
alongside the test that enforces it.

### Hard rules

> **Scope.** These 7 rules apply ONLY when a subdir has a sibling `.ts` / `.tsx` file at the parent level (the SPLIT pattern — e.g. `task-service.ts` next to `task-service/`). Subdirs without a sibling file (CATEGORY dirs — e.g. `packages/catalog/src/agent/`, `packages/catalog/src/facade/`, `packages/server/src/routes/`) are a separate, pre-existing organisational pattern and are unaffected by these rules; they MAY contain an `index.ts` barrel and follow the multi-entity / per-route conventions documented elsewhere on this page.

1. **Subdir basename equals facade basename AND is a direct sibling.** `task-service.ts` ↔ `task-service/` in the same directory. Enforced mechanically — see the structural test in `packages/e2e/test/architecture/split-convention.test.ts`. The subdir MUST sit next to its facade; a subdir at any other path (e.g. `src/internal/<role>/`) is not a recognised SPLIT and forfeits the no-barrel and package-private guarantees this convention provides.
2. **No barrel re-export** inside the subdir (no `<entity>-<role>/index.ts`). The facade composes via direct relative imports (`./task-service/queries.js` etc.). Enforced by the same structural test.
3. **Subdir files are package-private.** They MUST NOT appear in the package's top-level `src/index.ts` barrel. The facade is the only public surface.
4. **Concern files use bare names** (`queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, `shutdown.ts`) — the subdir name already supplies the entity context. Do NOT prefix (`task-queries.ts` inside `task-service/` is wrong).
5. **Each concern file ≤ ~450 LOC.** If a single concern grows beyond that, that concern itself needs further decomposition — but always keep at one level of nesting (do NOT nest `task-service/queries/by-id.ts`).
6. **Facade stays ≤ ~250 LOC** and contains only: constructor, ctx-object construction, and 1-line delegates to internals.
7. **Shared context.** The facade builds a `<Entity>ServiceCtx` (or similar) once and passes it to every internal — no `this`-casting, no widening of class field visibility. Each internal exports plain functions taking `(ctx, …args)` OR a small object that consumes ctx.

### On-disk reference example

`packages/_template/_examples/split-layout/` contains a self-contained,
fully-rule-compliant SPLIT skeleton with placeholder names — a
copyable shape for contributors making their first split. The
canonical real-world reference loaded with actual concern code is
`packages/task/src/task-service.ts` + `packages/task/src/task-service/`;
the `_examples/` version is the same shape stripped to placeholders so
the structure is the foreground.

The skeleton is **documentation that happens to be on disk**. It is
NOT built, NOT typechecked under any tsconfig, NOT run by any test —
the leading underscores on `_examples/` and `_template/` keep it out
of the structural classifier in
`packages/e2e/test/architecture/split-convention.test.ts` (see the
`entry.name.startsWith("_")` skip in `walkSrcDirs`), and the
scaffolder (`scripts/new-pkg.mjs`) skips this dir when copying so new
packages do not inherit it.

**Each hard rule mapped to its concrete artifact in the example:**

| Rule | Demonstrated by |
|------|-----------------|
| **#1** Subdir basename equals facade basename AND is a direct sibling | `__entity-kebab__-service.ts` next to `__entity-kebab__-service/` in the same directory |
| **#2** No barrel inside the subdir | The subdir contains `types.ts`, `queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, `lifecycle.ts`, `_helpers.ts` — no `index.ts` |
| **#3** Subdir files are package-private | The facade is the only thing a downstream `index.ts` would re-export; concern files are never named in the public barrel |
| **#4** Concern files use bare names | `queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, `lifecycle.ts` — no `__entity-kebab__-queries.ts` prefix |
| **#5** Each concern file ≤ ~450 LOC; no nesting | The skeleton concerns stay tiny; there is no `queries/by-id.ts` subdir |
| **#6** Facade ≤ ~250 LOC, only ctx construction + 1-line delegates | `__entity-kebab__-service.ts` does exactly that and stays under 100 LOC |
| **#7** Shared context | Facade builds `__Entity__ServiceCtx` once (defined in `__entity-kebab__-service/types.ts`) and passes it to every concern function. No `this`-casting, no field-visibility widening |

The `_helpers.ts` file inside the subdir demonstrates the
package-private utility seam: extract a helper there when **the same
logic appears in two or more concern files** (e.g. an ISO-timestamp
parser used by both `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts`). The leading `_`
on the filename is the same "package-private utility" signal as the
top-level `_shared.ts` files cited under "When NOT to use this
pattern" below. If a helper is used inside only one concern, keep it
private to that concern instead.

### Applying the convention

When your real `<entity>-service.ts` outgrows the 600 LOC / 3-concern
thresholds:

1. **Copy the structure, not the content** from
   `packages/_template/_examples/split-layout/` into your package's
   `src/` (the facade file + the matching subdir + the concern peer
   files). Do not copy the placeholder file bodies — write your own
   logic.
2. **Rename the placeholders.** Search-and-replace
   `__entity-kebab__` → your kebab-case entity name (e.g.
   `task-service`), and `__Entity__` → your `PascalCase` entity name
   (e.g. `Task`). The scaffolder's token substitution recipe is
   documented in `scripts/new-pkg.mjs`.
3. **Move methods into the appropriate concern peer file.** One
   concern at a time: cut the read methods from your old flat service
   into `queries.ts`, the write methods into `mutations.ts`, the
   lifecycle hooks into `lifecycle.ts`. Each function takes
   `(ctx, …args)` as its first parameter. The facade keeps only
   constructor + ctx-build + 1-line delegates — see the canonical
   real-world reference at `packages/task/src/task-service.ts`.
4. **Register the new SPLIT** — see § Migration of existing big files
   below for the exact `REQUIRED_SPLITS` /
   `EXPECTED_CATEGORY_DIRS_AT_CONVENTION_INTRODUCTION` updates.

### When NOT to use this pattern

- **Cross-entity shared infrastructure** → use a `_shared.ts` file (or a `_*` subdir) — the structural test skips any directory whose name starts with `_`, and treats `_`-prefixed files as ordinary peer modules outside any SPLIT registry. In-tree examples: `packages/server/src/routes/_shared.ts`, `packages/terminal/src/_shared.ts`, `packages/server/src/routes/_error-policies/` (`_shared-bodies.ts` inside it). The leading underscore signals "package-private utility, not a facade-split peer".
- **Component organisation** (e.g. a page + its sub-components) → `packages/dashboard/src/components/tasks/TaskDetail.tsx` + `TaskDetail/` already does this; it is a related but distinct pattern (the subdir contains presentational sub-components, not concern splits of one class). The same structural rules (no `index.tsx` barrel, exact-case sibling) apply.
- **Different concerns belonging to different services** in the same package → keep them as separate top-level `<entity>-<role>.ts` files (current convention).

### Migration of existing big files

Pre-existing big files do NOT need preemptive splitting. Apply this convention WHEN a refactor of that file is otherwise needed (e.g. a feature change, a bug fix that touches many sections, an audit-flagged improvement). PRs that opportunistically split should reference this section in the PR body.

**Registry maintenance (mandatory).** When you split a previously-flat file under this convention, also update `packages/e2e/test/architecture/split-convention.test.ts`:

- Add the new subdir's repo-relative path to `REQUIRED_SPLITS` so future PRs cannot silently delete the facade (the structural test asserts every entry still classifies as SPLIT). If you remove or collapse a SPLIT, drop the entry in the same PR — the test treats `REQUIRED_SPLITS` as the *exact* set of on-disk SPLITs and will fail on either drift direction.
- Remove the subdir from `EXPECTED_CATEGORY_DIRS_AT_CONVENTION_INTRODUCTION` if it was previously a CATEGORY (the SPLIT promotion turns the same path into a SPLIT, so leaving it in the snapshot would trip the "must still be CATEGORY" assertion).

The two registries together are the mechanical record of every applied SPLIT and every surveyed CATEGORY; they must move in lock-step with the source tree.

## Test file naming

Test files mirror the source file they test, with `.test.ts` appended.
Large suites split by feature with a `.<feature>` infix.

| source                          | test                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `<entity>-service.ts`           | `<entity>-service.test.ts`                      |
| `<entity>-service.ts` (per-feature suite) | `<entity>-service.<feature>.test.ts`  |
| `<entity>-repository.ts`        | `<entity>-repository.test.ts`                   |
| `<entity>-repository.ts` (per-feature) | `<entity>-repository.<feature>.test.ts`  |
| `<entity>-entity.ts`            | `<entity>-entity.test.ts`                       |
| `validate.ts`                   | `validate.test.ts`                              |
| `paths.ts`                      | `paths.test.ts`                                 |
| `compose.ts`                    | `compose.test.ts`                               |

Examples in-tree:
- `workspace-service.register.test.ts`, `workspace-service.rename.test.ts`,
  `workspace-service.reads.test.ts` — per-feature splits of the same
  service class.
- `task-service.cancel-orphan.test.ts`, `task-service.delete-no-longer-kills.test.ts`
  — per-scenario splits.
- `task-repository.failure-union.test.ts`, `task-repository.origin-filter.test.ts`
  — per-feature splits of the repository.

Tests under a sub-folder mirror the source sub-folder:
`packages/catalog/src/agent/agent-service.ts` →
`packages/catalog/test/agent/agent-service.test.ts`.

NEVER name a test file by an old class name (`manager.test.ts` was wrong
after `SessionManager` was renamed to `SessionService`) or by a non-source
concept word.

## Public API guard

Every pkg ships a `test/public-api-guard.test.ts` that uses Vitest's
`expectTypeOf` to lock the pkg's public surface at typecheck time.
The test:

- Asserts every method on the public service class exists by name.
- Asserts every declared error class is exported and constructible.
- Asserts every public DTO / interface shape.

Why: silent renames or accidental signature changes break downstream
consumers without warning. `expectTypeOf` catches them at
`pnpm typecheck` time, BEFORE downstream pkgs surface the
breakage. Because it is a type-only assertion, it costs nothing at
runtime.

When a public method, error class, or DTO is added / renamed / removed,
the guard test fails until updated in the SAME PR — review enforces
the coupling.

Reference shape: `packages/_template/test/public-api-guard.test.ts`.
Worked example: `packages/catalog/test/public-api-guard.test.ts`.

## Naming conventions

> See [docs/architecture.md § Coding conventions](./architecture.md#coding-conventions) for the full rationale.

### Public types (exported from `index.ts`)

| concept            | name                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| package name       | `@glyphs-ai/<pkg>`                    |
| **DTO** (wire shape)| `<Entity>` — bare noun             |
| list entry         | `<Entity>Entry` (only if it differs from DTO) |
| write+read surface | `<Entity>Service`                   |
| compose function   | `compose<Entity>Module`             |
| module options     | `<Entity>ModuleOptions`             |
| module result type | `<Entity>Module`                    |
| test-db helper     | `openTest<Entity>Db`                |

### Internal types (NOT exported)

| concept            | name                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Drizzle row        | `<Entity>Row`                       |
| repository class   | `<Entity>Repository`                |
| entity class (only if BC needs one) | `<Entity>Entity`     |

NEVER use these suffixes:
- `Manager` — replaced by `Service`
- `Queries` — merged into `Service`
- `View` / `Pojo` / `Dto` — replaced by bare-noun DTO

## Repository contract

> Industry research: Codex (Rust) `ThreadStore` returns plain
> `Stored*` structs (single domain type per concept; no separate
> wire DTO). Trigger.dev / Cal.com / Prisma consume ORM-inferred
> types directly. NestJS / Spring textbook splits Entity ↔ DTO
> across the repo/service boundary explicitly.
>
> glyph takes the **explicit 3-layer split** for consistency across
> rich (`catalog`, `task`) and anemic (`workspace`, `session`) BCs.
> The Entity layer makes the contract uniform; the row stays
> ORM-private; the DTO stays wire-stable.

### The 3 layers

| Layer | Lives in | Suffix | Visibility | Role |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Row** | `schema.ts` | `*Row` | pkg-private | Drizzle `$inferSelect` shape; tracks the table |
| **Entity** | `<entity>-entity.ts` | `*Entity` | pkg-private (NOT re-exported from index.ts) | Pkg-owned domain shape; `interface` for anemic BCs, `class` for rich (state machine / invariants) |
| **DTO** | `types.ts` | **bare noun** (no suffix) | exported from index.ts | Wire shape; what `<Entity>Service` returns; stable contract for HTTP / CLI / other pkgs |

### Repository contract (hard rule)

> **`<Entity>Repository`'s public read methods return the pkg-owned
> `<Entity>Entity` type. They MUST NOT return `<Entity>Row`.**
>
> **`<Entity>Service`'s public methods return the wire `<Entity>` DTO.**

### Projection helpers — write them only when they earn their keep

For **anemic BCs** where Row and Entity are structurally identical,
the row assigns directly to `Entity` via TypeScript structural
typing — no `rowToEntity` helper needed:

```ts
async findById(id: string): Promise<WorkspaceEntity | undefined> {
  return this.db.select().from(workspaces).where(eq(workspaces.id, id)).get();
}
```

Similarly, when Entity → DTO is a trivial spread + 1-line
normalisation, inline it at each service read call site rather
than extracting a helper:

```ts
async getById(id: string): Promise<Workspace | null> {
  const entity = await this.repo.findById(id);
  return entity ? { ...entity, lastOpenedAt: entity.lastOpenedAt ?? entity.createdAt } : null;
}
```

Extract a `rowToEntity` / `entityToDto` helper when:
- Row gains columns that must NOT bleed into Entity (e.g.
  soft-delete `deletedAt`), OR
- Multiple service methods do the same non-trivial projection, OR
- The projection is async / requires cross-pkg context (e.g.
  `SessionEntity` + workdir computation + live runtime metadata
  → `Session` DTO — see `session-service.ts draftFromEntity`).

### When Entity is a class (rich BC)

Add `<entity>-entity.ts` as a `class` instead of an `interface`
when the BC needs:
- Non-trivial state transitions (`running → succeeded`)
- Invariant validation on every mutation
- Immutable functional updates (`entity.withMetadata(...)`)

In-tree examples: `catalog/agent/agent-entity.ts` (frontmatter
validation, `acknowledgePrereqs`), `task/task-entity.ts` (FSM).
Repository still returns the Entity class instance; service
projects to DTO at the wire boundary.

### Why this shape

1. **Single mental model across rich and anemic BCs.** Every
   repository returns `Entity`; every service returns DTO. New
   contributors learn one pattern.
2. **No ORM leak.** `*Row` never crosses the repository boundary;
   swapping Drizzle for something else only touches
   `schema.ts` + `<entity>-repository.ts`.
3. **No type lies.** Wire-side normalisation (`string | null` →
   `string`, composite assembly from row + cross-pkg fetch) has a
   designated home in the service, not scattered across consumers.
4. **Anemic BCs pay zero ceremony today.** The Entity is just a
   typed alias of the row's structural shape; no class, no
   helper functions, no boilerplate. The naming separation
   carries the contract.
5. **Growth path is clear.** If workspace gains a state machine
   tomorrow, `workspace-entity.ts` flips from `interface` to
   `class` and the repository signature stays the same.



## Single service per BC

Every BC exposes exactly ONE public class:

- **`<Entity>Service`** — both reads (list / get / lookup) and writes
  (create / update / delete / state transitions). Returns DTOs.

The previous read/write class split (`<Entity>Queries` + `<Entity>Service`)
was retired: industry research (codex, NestJS, tRPC, Cal.com, Plane,
Coder) found everyone uses a single class per BC. The split added
indirection without payoff at glyph's scale.

If a downstream package only needs a narrow subset of methods, declare
a small **capability interface** in the downstream package and depend
on that, rather than importing the whole service type:

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/types.ts — minimal surface for "resolve an agent"
export interface AgentContentSource {
  resolveAgent(fqn: string): Promise<AgentResolveResult>;
  // ... 3 more methods, total 4
}
```

The downstream pkg accepts `AgentContentSource`; the composition root
passes a `CatalogService` instance (which structurally implements the
interface). This is a real example from `@glyphs-ai/runtime`.

## Composition root

The composition root (`@glyphs-ai/api`'s `WorkspaceContextRegistry.load`)
calls each `compose<Entity>Module({ dbFile })` once per workspace and
threads the `service` into downstream pkgs (either as-is or through a
capability interface).

## Errors

All errors live in `src/errors.ts`. Convention:

```typescript
export class XxxError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, options?: { cause?: unknown }) {
    super(message, options as ErrorOptions);
    this.name = "XxxError";
  }
}

export class XxxNotFoundError extends XxxError {
  override readonly name = "XxxNotFoundError";
  constructor(public readonly id: string) {
    super(`Xxx "${id}" not found`);
  }
}
```

Two rules:
1. Every BC has a base `<Entity>Error` class; specific errors extend it.
   Same-realm callers can `catch (e) { if (e instanceof XxxError) … }`.
2. Subclasses declare `override readonly name = "..."` with a literal
   string equal to the class name. Do NOT use `this.name = new.target.name`
   — bundlers can name-mangle the class and break it.

Route / CLI layers should branch on `error.name` (string literal), NOT on
`instanceof XxxError` — bundlers can split the class definition across
chunks and `instanceof` will silently fail across package boundaries.

### Catch-block error normalization (inline only)

Do NOT create `src/utils/errors.ts` or any helper file for catch-block
error normalization (`errorMessage`, `isAbortError`, etc.). Use the
inline form at each `catch (e) { ... }` site:

```ts
const msg = e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e);
```

For abort-error detection:

```ts
if (e instanceof Error && e.name === "AbortError") return;
```

Rationale: these checks are tiny, stateless, and benefit from local
readability over a shared abstraction. Backend packages do not use a
`src/utils/` subfolder — keep `src/` flat. (Dashboard's `src/utils/`
is a frontend convention with multiple files like `fqn.ts`, `time.ts`;
that pattern is fine for the dashboard, but error normalization stays
inline there too.)

## Migrations

Drizzle migrations live under `drizzle/` and are committed. To
regenerate after a schema change:

```sh
pnpm -F @glyphs-ai/<pkg> db:generate
```

After drizzle-kit writes a new `drizzle/NNNN_*.sql`, **add a one-line
import + array entry to `src/migrations.ts`** so the new file is
embedded into the runtime bundle. The `migrations-inventory` test (per
pkg) fails immediately if `migrations.ts` drifts from `drizzle/`. CI
also runs `db:generate` against `schema.ts` and fails if it produces a
diff (catches forgotten regeneration).

```ts
// src/migrations.ts — hand-maintained
// @ts-expect-error  "?raw" is Vite syntax, resolved by esbuild plugin
import sql_0001 from "../drizzle/0001_new_thing.sql?raw";

export const MIGRATIONS = [
  // existing entries...
  { name: "0001_new_thing.sql", sql: sql_0001 },
];
```

At runtime, `compose.ts`'s `runPendingMigrations()` walks `MIGRATIONS`
in order, skipping anything already recorded in `__drizzle_migrations`.
SQL is embedded as a string in the JS bundle (via Vite's `?raw` /
esbuild's `rawSuffixPlugin`) — no filesystem reads at runtime. Same
applies in `testing.ts` so in-memory test DBs see the same schema.

## Optional patterns

The standard skeleton above covers a single-entity BC with no extra
concerns. The patterns below appear in some real packages and are
documented here so newcomers know when and how to add them. **Do not
copy them into a new package unless the package actually needs them.**

### Filesystem-owning BCs → `src/paths.ts`

If the BC owns a directory layout under a root the composer hands it
(e.g. session owns `<workspace>/sessions/`, task owns `<workspace>/tasks/`),
add a small `src/paths.ts` that centralizes the path math:

```typescript
// src/paths.ts
import path from "node:path";

export function xxxDir(root: string, id: string): string {
  // SECURITY: refuses ids that try to escape via "..", absolute paths, etc.
  return safeJoinUnderRoot(root, id);
}

export function safeJoinUnderRoot(root: string, ...parts: string[]): string {
  // ... implementation; see packages/task/src/paths.ts for the canonical version
}
```

The service imports from `paths.ts` instead of doing `path.join` inline.
Existing examples: `packages/task/src/paths.ts`,
`packages/workflow/src/paths.ts`. (`session` keeps the same guard in
`packages/session/src/session-service/_helpers.ts` rather than a
dedicated `paths.ts`, since its path math lives next to the service
split.)

**Known duplication (intentional, for now).** `safeJoinUnderRoot` is
copied near-verbatim across each filesystem-owning BC (`task/src/paths.ts`,
`workflow/src/paths.ts`, and `session/src/session-service/_helpers.ts`)
rather than shared from a common module. This is deliberate: the guard
is a few lines of security-critical path math, each BC owns its own root
invariant, and a shared helper would create a cross-BC import that the
tier rules (see `docs/architecture.md`) would otherwise forbid at this
layer. If a fourth substrate appears, or the guard grows non-trivial,
revisit extracting it into a tier-0 utility — until then, keep the
copies in lockstep and do not reach across BCs.

### Multi-entity BCs → subfolder per entity + `facade/`

If the BC owns more than one rich entity that participates in
cross-entity orchestration (catalog owns Agent + Skill + Mcp), mirror
the standard layout into per-entity subfolders. **The file-naming
convention is the same — `<entity>-<role>.ts` even inside a subfolder**:

```
src/
  schema.ts                 cross-entity table definitions
  types.ts                  cross-entity DTOs (bare nouns: Agent / Skill / Mcp) — same filename as single-entity BCs
  index.ts                  public barrel

  agent/
    agent-entity.ts         AgentEntity class (internal)
    agent-repository.ts     AgentRepository (internal)
    agent-service.ts        per-entity write logic (internal)
    errors.ts               per-entity errors (bare role file)
    validate.ts             per-entity input validators (bare role file)
    index.ts                subfolder barrel

  skill/  … mirror
  mcp/
    mcp-entity.ts
    mcp-repository.ts
    mcp-service.ts
    mcp-format.ts           entity-specific format helpers
    errors.ts
    validate.ts
    index.ts

  facade/
    catalog-service.ts      unified read+write surface across all entities
    plan-types.ts           shared cross-entity DTOs
    projection.ts           pure projection helpers (Row → DTO)
    errors.ts
    index.ts                facade barrel

  compose.ts                composeCatalogModule({...})
```

The per-entity `<entity>-service.ts` classes are **internal** to the
BC; they are not exported from the package barrel. External callers go
through the facade only. Existing example: `packages/catalog/`.

### Test seams (clock, randomness)

Service constructors accept an optional `{ now?: () => Date; randomBytes?: (n: number) => Buffer }`
opts object when the service touches the clock or generates ids. Pass
fakes from tests; production callers omit the opts to get the real ones.
The template's `__Entity__Service` shows the minimal `now?` pattern.
